Section: Students
Date Created: October 2009
Date Edited: October 2012
Fund raising by pupils is not permitted except upon the approval of the Board of Education and/or the Superintendent.
The Board of Education recognizes the value of having pupils participate in fund-raising activities, either individually or as a group; in order to help defray the cost of certain non-curricular field trips, or other worthwhile programs, or in support of a bona fide charitable cause.
Requests for fund-raising should be submitted to the Superintendent, via the Building Principal, in a timely fashion so that such requests can be included in the Superintendent's report to the Board prior to regular Board meetings.
Should unusual or extenuating circumstances preclude this timely notice; the Superintendent may approve such a request administratively and then report the activity to the Board.
Fundraisers by PTA and other outside organizations related to the school must be approved by the Superintendent.
Principals shall review and decide the appropriateness of fund-raising efforts by pupils in the individual school for school-related purposes.
The Superintendent shall review proposed activities, which would involve more than one school, an outside purpose, or off school property location (i.e.
"tagging" outside of local businesses, soliciting business by individuals or groups, etc.).
The Superintendent, in cooperation with Principals, shall develop guidelines for the conduct of all in-school fund-raising activities by pupils and shall report such activities to the Board.
The Board shall review and act on all proposals for fund-raising activities by pupils outside school property.
All money shall be deposited and accounted for in accordance with Board policy and current New Jersey law.
The annual school district audit shall include an audit of pupil organization funds.
Payment of the audit shall be made from district funds.
The following guidelines must be considered prior to requesting the approval of a fund-raising activity:

2.
No food, candy, etc.
may be sold while classes are in session;
3.

Fund-raisers may not be undertaken to accumulate funds for unspecified objectives.
Fund-raisers will be approved only for appropriate specific goals;

A request for the dedication of the funds to a specific purpose should be made at the time the fund-raiser is proposed;
9.
Any proposed fund-raising activity that involves a "small game of chance" (i.e.
50/50, auctions, raffle, etc.), must meet the requirements under the Charitable Registration and Investigation Act and the New Jersey Gaming Laws;
10.
No door-to-door sales of any kind are permitted;
11.
All fund-raising activities, where pupils are involved, are representative of Manville School District and all participants must understand that they are representing the district and their behavior and dress should be appropriate as such;
