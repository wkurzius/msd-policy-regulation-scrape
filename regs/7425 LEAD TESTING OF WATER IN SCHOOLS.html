Testing of Drinking Water
1.
Schedule
a.
Sampling shall be conducted in accordance with a lead sampling plan, which shall include:
(1) A plumbing survey for each facility that identifies how water enters and flows through each facility, the types of plumbing materials used in the facility, such as the service line, piping, solder, fixtures, drinking water outlets where students or staff have or may have access, and point of use treatment, such as drinking water filters;
(2) The names and responsibilities of all individuals involved in sampling; and
(3) The following sampling procedures:
(a) Samples shall be taken after water has sat undisturbed in the school pipes for at least eight hours, but no more than forty-eight hours before the sample is taken.
(i) 24-hour school facilities shall collect first-draw samples at drinking water outlets following a stagnation time that would likely result in the longest standing time;
(b) At least eight hours prior to sampling, signs shall be posted to indicate that water shall not be used and access to the buildings subject to the sampling shall be restricted to all but authorized staff members;
(c) Existing aerators, screens, and filters shall not be replaced or removed prior to or during sampling; and
(d) All samples shall be collected in pre-cleaned high-density polyethylene (HDPE) 250 milliliter (mL) wide-mouth single-use rigid sample containers that are properly labeled.
2.
Analysis of Samples
a.
Analysis of samples shall be conducted as follows:
(1) Analysis shall be conducted by a certified laboratory to analyze for lead in drinking water;
(2) The laboratory shall use an approved analytical method pursuant to the Federal Safe Drinking Water Act at 40 CFR 141.23(k)(1); and
(3) Sample analysis shall be conducted in accordance with a Quality Assurance Project Plan (QAPP), which shall be signed by the Board, the certified laboratory, and the individual responsible for conducting the sampling.
The QAPP shall include the identification of analytical methods, chain of custody procedures, data validation and reporting processes, detection limits, reporting to three significant figures, field blanks, and quality control measures required by the certified method.
b.
The Superintendent or designee may utilize a technical guidance manual, which will be developed by the New Jersey Department of Education (NJDOE), in consultation with the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP), to assist in the school district’s compliance with the sampling and analysis requirements of this Regulation.
