“Adult student” means a person who is at least eighteen years of age or is an emancipated minor.
3.
“Days in membership” means the number of school days in session in which a student is enrolled.
A student’s membership begins on the first possible day of attendance following enrollment during the school year, notwithstanding the actual day the student was recorded as present for the first time.
4.
“Health history” means the record of a person’s past health events obtained in writing, completed by the individual or the individual’s physician.
5.
“Mandated student records” means student records that school districts compile pursuant to State statute, regulation, or authorized administrative directive.
6.
“Parent” means the natural or adoptive parent, legal guardian, surrogate parent appointed pursuant to N.J.A.C.
6A:14-2.2, or a person acting in place of a parent (such as a grandparent or stepparent with whom the student lives or a person legally responsible for the student’s welfare).
Unless parental rights have been terminated by a court of appropriate jurisdiction, the parent retains all rights pursuant to N.J.A.C.
6A:32.
In addition, a resource family parent may act as a parent pursuant to the provisions of N.J.A.C.
6A:32 if the parent’s authority to make educational decisions on the student’s behalf has been terminated by a court of appropriate jurisdiction.
7.
“Permitted student records” means records that the Board of Education has authorized, by resolution adopted at a regular public meeting, to be collected to promote the educational welfare of students.
8.
“Personally identifiable information” means, but is not limited to:
a.
The student's name;
b.
The name of the student's parent(s) or other family members;
c.
The address of the student or the student's family;
d.
The email address of the student, the student's parent(s), or other family members;
e.
The telephone number of the student, the student's parent(s), or other family members;
f.
A personal identifier, such as the student's Social Security number, student number, or biometric record;
g.
A photo of the student;
h.
The location and times of class trips;
i.
Other indirect identifiers, such as the student's date of birth, place of birth, and mother's maiden name;
j.
Other information that, alone or in combination, is linked or linkable to a specific student that would allow a reasonable person in the school community who does not have personal knowledge of the relevant circumstances to identify the student with reasonable certainty; or
k.
Information requested by a person who the district, or private agency that provides educational services by means of public funds, reasonably believes knows the identity of the student to whom the student record relates.
9.
“Physical examination” means the assessment of an individual’s health, in accordance with the requirements at N.J.A.C.
6A:16-2.2.
10.
“School contact directory for official use” means a compilation by a district that includes the following information for each student:  name, address, telephone number, date of birth, and school of enrollment.
The directory may be provided for official use only to judicial, law enforcement, and medical personnel.
11.
“Student discipline record” means information regarding all disciplinary actions taken against a student by a school district pursuant to N.J.S.A.
18A:36-25.1.b.
and that is maintained in a student’s record.
12.
“Student information directory” means a publication of the Board that includes information relating to a student.
It shall be used only by authorized school district personnel and for designated official use by judicial, law enforcement, and medical personnel and not for general public consumption.
The information shall be the student’s:  name; grade level; date and place of birth; dates of school attendance; major field of study; participation in officially recognized activities; weight and height relating to athletic team membership; degrees; awards; the most recent educational agency attended by the student; and other similar information.
13.
“Student record” means information related to an individual student gathered within or outside the school district and maintained within the school district, regardless of the physical form in which it is maintained.
Essential in this definition is the idea that any information that is maintained for the purpose of second-party review is considered a student record.
Therefore, information recorded by certified school personnel solely as a memory aid and not for the use of a second party is excluded from this definition.
In the absence of any “information related to an individual student,” the document(s) no longer meets the definition of “student record.”
B.
