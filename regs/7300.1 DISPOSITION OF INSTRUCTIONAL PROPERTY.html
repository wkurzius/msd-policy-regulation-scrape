The School Business Administrator/Board Secretary shall appoint committees comprised of teachers, administrators, and librarians, as appropriate to the grade level and subject matter to assess periodically the continuing usefulness of instructional property in the school or program.
2.
The committees will recommend for removal or replacement instructional property that:
a.
Is so worn and/or damaged as to preclude effective use and economical repair or restoration,

Approval by the Board of Education is required for disposing of instructional property.
Any such recommendation must comply with Policy Nos.
2530 and 9130, which require that the reason for disposal accompany the recommendation.
No material may be removed and disposed of solely because it presents ideas that may be unpopular or offensive to some.
C.
Disposal
