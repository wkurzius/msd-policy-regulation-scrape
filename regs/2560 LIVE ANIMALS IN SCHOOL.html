A.
Standards for Use
1.
A teacher or other qualified adult supervisor must assume primary responsibility for the purposes and conditions of any study, activity, or performance that involves live animals in school.
2.
Each study involving live animals will have as a clearly defined objective the teaching of some biological principle(s).
3.
All animals used must be lawfully acquired in accordance with state and local laws, be healthy and free from transmissible diseases, and must have been vaccinated against rabies if susceptible.
4.
Animals may be handled only by the responsible adult supervisor and the pupil(s) directly involved in the study or performance.
5.
Animals must be properly fed and provided with sanitary cage quarters.
6.
Any experiment in nutritional deficiency or one which exposes the animal to undue harm or stress may proceed only to the point where the purposes of the experiment are achieved.
Appropriate measures shall then be taken to correct the deficiency if such action is feasible.
If the deficiency cannot be corrected, the animal must be destroyed by humane methods.
7.
Studies involving anesthetic drugs, surgical procedures, pathogenic organisms, toxicological products, carcinogens, or radiation, shall be undertaken only under the direction of a certified teacher or other qualified adult, (e.g.: biologist, dentist, physician, or veterinarian) trained in the experimental procedure involved.
Any requirements of the State Departments of Health and Education concerning the handling of radiation and pathogenic organisms must be met.
8.
Any study involving pain must be done with the animal under anesthesia insofar as this procedure does not interfere with the clearly defined objectives of the study.
9.
When animals are kept in school quarters over vacation periods, adequate housing must be provided and a qualified caretaker must be assigned the specific duties of care and feeding.
10.
Teachers of pupils pursuing investigations at other than regular class periods while in school as part of a school assignment or project (such as a school science fair) will be bound by these regulations.
11.
Dangerous species of animals will not be permitted in classrooms without permission from the Principal and only when the animal is under the constant supervision of a person qualified and trained to handle said animal.
12.
The Principal or designee will make a determination that no pupil in a class where the animal will be housed is allergic to the animal and would suffer an adverse reaction to the animal.
The Principal or designee should also attempt to determine, if any other pupil in the school building could suffer an adverse reaction.
If the Principal or designee determines that there is a pupil(s) who would suffer an adverse reaction, the Principal shall deny approval to house the animal in the school.
B.

8441 for The Care of Injured And Ill Persons; and
