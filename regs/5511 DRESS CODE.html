Pupils are expected to dress in acceptable manner and style while on the school campus.
Personal appearance shall be such that it does not disrupt schoolwork or school order, become distracting to the members of the opposite sex, or violate health and safety rules.
Therefore, certain types of clothing which
may be acceptable for recreation wear may not be suitable for school.

The administration has the authority to determine when personal appearance and dress style do not meet school standards.
In these instances, administrators may request parent(s) or legal guardian(s) to bring appropriate clothing so that the pupil may change or send the pupil home to change clothing.
Consequences for inappropriate dress will be issued in accordance with the code of conduct.
Goggles and lab aprons will be worn in courses where they are required, and shoes rather than
