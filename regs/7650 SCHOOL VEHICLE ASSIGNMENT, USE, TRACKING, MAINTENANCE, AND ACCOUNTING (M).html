The Board of Education, upon the recommendation of the Superintendent, may authorize, at its discretion, by an affirmative vote of the Board’s full membership, the lease, lease-purchase, or purchase and assignment of school district vehicles for the conduct of official school district business.

The vehicles may be assigned either to individuals or to units within the school district for pool use according to the following classifications:
a.
Vehicles may be assigned permanently and individually to the Superintendent, School Business Administrator/Board Secretary, the staff member serving as head of facilities services, the staff member serving as head of security services or other supervisory employees who, based on their job duties, may be called upon on a twenty-four hour, seven day-a-week basis.
No individual assignment shall be made for the primary purpose of commuting.
b.
A unit may be permanently assigned one or more school district pool vehicles only if employees of the unit will collectively use the vehicle or each vehicle for more than an average of 750 miles per month on official school district business.
Pool vehicles shall not be used for the purpose of commuting and shall remain at a school district facility when not in official use.
2.
Board members or employees may be temporarily assigned a school district vehicle for travel events.

In the event the operator of a school district vehicle believes their personal health (temporary or long-term) may impair their ability to safely operate a school vehicle, the operator shall inform their immediate supervisor and the school vehicle coordinator of the health problem and the expected duration of impairment.
The operator’s immediate supervisor or the school vehicle coordinator may coordinate a physical examination for the staff member in accordance with Policy 3160 or 4160.

Smoking, as defined in Policy 7434, is prohibited on “school grounds” and therefore, in accordance with the definition of school grounds in Policy 7434, smoking is prohibited in a school district vehicle at any time.

If a vehicle is assigned to the Superintendent, it may be a full size or intermediate, four-door sedan of the non-luxury class.
All other vehicles shall be compact sedans, unless special passenger, cargo, equipment, or use requirements make the standard vehicle unsuitable for documented school district needs.
