Section: Support Staff
Date Created: October 2009
Date Edited: October 2009
A.
Eligibility for Sick Leave
1.
Each person steadily employed by this district will be paid in full, to the limit of his/her entitlement, for days on which the employee is absent from work because of:
a.
Personal disability due to the employee’s illness or injury;
b.
The employee’s exclusion from school by the school district’s medical authorities on account of a contagious disease; or
c.
The employee’s having been quarantined for a contagious disease in his/her immediate household.
2.
Whatever the claims of disability, no day of absence shall be considered to be a sick leave day on which the employee:
a.
Has engaged in or prepared for gainful employment with an employer other than the Board;
b.
Has participated in a concerted work stoppage; or
c.
Has engaged in any activity, vocational or avocational, that clearly refutes the employee’s claim of disability or quarantine.
B.
Call in Procedures
1.
An employee who anticipates a day of disability should make every reasonable effort to so notify his/her immediate supervisor no later than the day before the absence, to allow sufficient time for the securing of any substitute services that may be required.
2.
Notice of the disability should include a reasonable estimate of the duration of the disability.
3.
An employee who becomes aware of his/her disability on the morning of the absence must call the substitute line at 908-707-9501 as soon as possible or before 6:30 a.m.
4.
An employee who becomes disabled during the school day must so inform the Building Principal as promptly as possible and request permission to leave the school premises.
5.
In all instances, the employee should call personally to report sick leave.
An agent may be appointed to call in sick leave only when the employee is so incapacitated as to make a personal call inadvisable or impossible.
C.
Sick Leave Charges
1.
A sick leave absence commences when the absence is called in pursuant to paragraph B.
a.
An employee who leaves school early because of a disability will not be charged with a sick leave day provided the absence commences after the hour of 1:30 p.m.
2.
A sick leave day once commenced may be reinstated as a working day only with the approval of the administrator.
3.
An employee absent on sick leave on a day when the school is closed early for emergency reasons will be charged with a full sick leave day.
4.
An employee scheduled for a sick leave absence on a day on which the schools do not open because of an emergency (such as a snow day) will not be charged with a sick leave day.
D.
Verification of Sick Leave
1.
An employee absent for reasons of disability more than three consecutive working days shall submit the signed statement of his/her physician indicating:
a.
The reason for the employee’s absence, as personally known to the physician, and
b.
If the employee is not immediately returning to work, the anticipated duration of the employee’s disability.
2.
The Board may, at its discretion, require the employee to submit to examination by the school medical inspector or a physician designated by the school medical inspector.
3.
If the results of the examination conducted pursuant to paragraph D2 are inconsistent with the statement of the employee’s physician, the two examining physicians shall agree in good faith on a third physician, who shall examine the employee and whose medical opinion shall be conclusive and binding as to the employee’s disability on days claimed for sick leave.
E.
Readmission After Disability
1.
An employee who wishes to return to work after sick leave of more than three consecutive working days shall submit a signed statement of his/her physician indicating the employee’s fitness to perform his/her duties.
2.
The Superintendent may, in his/her discretion, require the employee to submit to examination by the school medical inspector or a physician designated by the school medical inspector.
3.
If the results of the examination conducted pursuant to paragraph D2 is inconsistent with the statement of the employee’s physician, the two examining physicians shall agree in good faith on a third physician, who shall examine the employee and whose medical opinion shall be conclusive and binding as to the employee’s fitness to return to service.
F.
Exhaustion of Sick Leave
1.
The building secretary will monitor each employee’s sick leave bank and charge the employee’s bank of accumulated sick leave with sick leave days in accordance with Policy No.
4432 and this regulation.
2.
When it is apparent that an employee on extended sick leave will utilize the last sick leave day to which he/she is entitled within five working days, the School Business Administrator will so inform the employee by written notice.
The notice will include a statement of the employee’s right to request the Board for an extension of sick leave.
3.
A request for the extension of sick leave should be submitted to the Superintendent at least ten working days in advance of the next Board meeting.
The request must be accompanied by a physician’s signed statement setting forth the nature and anticipated duration of the employee’s disability.
4.
An employee who anticipates an extended period of disability may apply to the Board for a disability leave of absence, during which the employee will receive no compensation or benefits, pursuant to Policy No.
4431.
5.
Employees are reminded that sick leave extensions and disability leaves of absence are not entitlements and will be granted or denied by the Board on a case by case basis.
G.
Accumulation of Sick Leave
1.
Sick leave will be charged, first, to the sick leave newly available in the employee’s current contract year and, when that sick leave entitlement is exhausted, to the employee’s bank of accumulated sick leave.
2.
At the beginning of each contract year, leave newly available but unused in the prior contract year will be carried forward and credited to a full-time employee’s bank of sick leave.
3.
The unused sick leave of part-time employees will be accumulated on the basis of hours of work rather than days of work.
a.
At the close of each contract year, the number of sick leave days not used by a part-time employee will be multiplied by the number of hours the employee worked in each day or, if the employee worked irregular hours, the average number of hours in each contract day.
b.
At the beginning of the following contract year, the total number of hours accumulated will be divided by the number of hours, or average number of hours, to be worked in each contract day.
The result constitutes the number of accrued sick leave days the employee may claim when he/she has exhausted the sick leave days available in the current contract year.
c.
When a part-time employee, continuously employed in the district, is employed full-time, his/her accumulated sick leave hours will be divided by the number of hours in a full working day, and the dividend will be multiplied by the number of days he/she worked each week as a part-time employee.
The product will be divided by five, the number of days in a full-time week.
The resulting number, rounded up to the next full day, represents the number of accrued sick leave days in the employee’s sick leave bank.
H.
Records
1.
The personnel file of each person employed by this district will include an accurate record of the employee’s attendance in accordance with Policy No.
4211.
2.
Each employee’s attendance record will record the reason for any absence.
3.
The attendance record will include the accumulated unused sick leave in the employee’s sick leave bank.
