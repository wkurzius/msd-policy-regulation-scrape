2200  - CURRICULUM CONTENT
Section: Program
Date Created: October 2009
Date Edited: May 2017
M
Courses of study and instructional materials and programs shall be designed to eliminate discrimination and promote understanding and mutual respect between children regardless of races, colors, creeds, age, marital status, affectional or sexual orientation, gender, gender identity or expression, religion, ancestry, national origins, socioeconomic status, and/or disability.
In order to eliminate possible bias in the curriculum, staff shall use the following criteria:
A.
When instructional material contains stereotypes or discriminatory statements, staff should help students identify the stereotypes or discriminatory statement(s) and discuss with students the consequences of repeated stereotyping and discriminatory statements.
B.
If a particular instructional material is highly objectionable, staff should not use it, such material should be brought to the attention of the Building Principal so that the Affirmative Action Officer can evaluate the objectionable material.
Alternatively, the teacher might discuss the questionable material instead of eliminating it, depending on the makeup and maturity of the class and the purposes of the instruction.
C.
Another recommended technique for handling materials that contain biases or stereotypes is to offset it by using unbiased supplementary materials.
D.
Community involvement when developing instructional programs and attendant materials shall be encouraged.
