(1) The nature, duration, and severity of the risk;
(2) The probability that the potential injury will actually occur; and

(2) Is participating in a supervised rehabilitation program; or
(3) Is erroneously regarded as engaging in such use.
b.
While the Act does not prohibit discrimination against an individual based on that individual's current illegal use of drugs, the district will not deny health services or services provided in connection with drug rehabilitation to an individual on the basis of that individual's current illegal use of drugs, if the individual is otherwise entitled to such services.
c.

(3) Exclude or otherwise deny equal jobs or benefits to a qualified individual because of the known disability of an individual with whom the qualified individual is known to associate or have a relationship;
(4) Fail to make reasonable accommodations to known physical or mental limitations of an otherwise qualified individual with a disability or deny employment opportunities to such qualified individual unless the district can demonstrate that the accommodation would impose undue hardship to district operations;

(a)        Full compliance with the requirements of 28 CFR §35.151 is not required where the district can demonstrate that it is structurally impracticable to meet the requirements.
