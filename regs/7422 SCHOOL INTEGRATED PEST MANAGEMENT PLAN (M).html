The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) register pesticides to determine that the use of a pesticide in accordance with instructions printed on the label does not pose an unreasonable risk to human health and the environment.
Nevertheless, the EPA and DEP cannot guarantee that registered pesticides do not pose any risk to human health, thus unnecessary exposure to pesticides should be avoided.
The EPA has issued the statement that where possible, persons who are potentially sensitive, such as pregnant women, infants and children, should avoid unnecessary pesticide exposure.”
After the beginning of each school year, the IPMC, in conjunction with the Building Principal(s), shall provide this notice to each new staff member who is employed during the school year and to the parent(s) or legal guardian(s) of each new pupil enrolled during the school year.

A pesticide, other than a low impact pesticide, shall not be applied on school property where pupils are expected to be present for academic instruction or for organized extra-curricular activities prior to the time prescribed for re-entry to the application site by the United States Environmental Protection Agency on the pesticide label, except that if no specific numerical re-entry time is prescribed on a pesticide label, such a pesticide, other than a low impact pesticide, shall not be applied on school property where pupils are expected to be present for academic instruction or for organized extra-curricular activities within seven hours of the application.
A pesticide, other than a low impact pesticide, shall not be applied in a school building when pupils are present.
Pupils may not be present in an untreated portion of a school building being treated unless the area being treated with a pesticide, other than a low impact pesticide, is served by a separate ventilation system and is separated from the untreated area by smoke or fire doors.
A low impact pesticide may be applied in areas of a school building where pupils will not contact treated areas until sufficient time is allowed for the substance to dry or settle, or after the period of time prescribed for re-entry or for ventilation requirements on the pesticide label has elapsed.
The requirements of this section shall not apply when pesticides are applied on school property for pupil instructional purposes or by public health officials during the normal course of their duties.
H.
Immunity From Liability of Commercial Pesticide Applicator
A commercial pesticide applicator shall not be liable to any person for damages resulting from the application of a pesticide at a school if the damages are solely due to the failure of the IPMC to provide the notice required prior to the application of a pesticide pursuant to the provisions of sections 7, 8, 9, or 10 of P.L.

The form developed pursuant to this section shall set forth a certification by the Integrated Pest Management Coordinator (IPMC) that the notice and posting requirements for the application of a pesticide established pursuant to Sections D and E of this Regulation, or the posting requirement established pursuant to Section G of this Regulation, as appropriate, have met compliance requirements.
Upon being presented by a commercial pesticide applicator with a form pursuant to this section, the signature of the Integrated Pest Management Coordinator (IPMC) shall be required as a condition for the application of the pesticide.
The Department of Environmental Protection may issue an administrative order against a local school Board that fails to adopt and implement a pesticide use and school Integrated Pest Management Policy in compliance with the provisions of N.J.S.A.
13:1F-32.
The Commissioner shall adopt, pursuant to the provisions of the “Administrative Procedure Act,” P.L.1968, c.410 (C.52:14B-1 et seq.), such rules or regulations as are necessary to implement the provisions of the School Integrated Pest Management Act.
