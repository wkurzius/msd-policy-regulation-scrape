Attendance Improvement Plan
1.
Planning
The Superintendent will meet with Building Principals and appropriate administrators to discuss the attendance summary.

Specific strategies for reducing the rate of absence shall be developed.

Implementation

In-service Training
The Principal shall meet with the teaching staff members assigned to his/her building at the beginning of each school year to inform employees of Board policy and district regulations on attendance, to familiarize employees with the forms to be used in reporting and verifying absences, to review with employees the cost of absenteeism to the district and the value of accumulated sick leave to the employee, and to acquaint employees with the degree to which attendance will affect evaluation reports.
4.
Counseling
a.
The Building Principal may, in his/her discretion, call a conference with a teaching staff member where the number and/or pattern of the members’ absences or the reasons offered for the member’s absences indicate a misunderstanding of the teaching staff member’s responsibility to the school district or the possible misuse of the privilege of paid leave.

Prior to the giving of any admonition or reprimand or imposition of discipline of any kind, the Principal shall determine the nature of the absences and consider any extenuating circumstances.
c.
A written report of any attendance conference shall be prepared and retained with the teaching staff member’s evaluations.
