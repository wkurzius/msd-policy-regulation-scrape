F.
Bidder Disqualification
1.
The Board may, by resolution approved by a majority of the Board, and pursuant to N.J.S.A.
18A:18A-4 disqualify a bidder who would otherwise be determined to be the lowest responsible bidder, if the Board finds that it has had prior negative experience with the bidder.
a.
As used in this section, "prior negative experience" means any of the following:
(1) The bidder has been found, through either court adjudication, arbitration, mediation, or other contractually stipulated alternate dispute resolution mechanism, to have: failed to provide or perform goods or services; or failed to complete the contract in a timely manner; or otherwise performed unsatisfactorily under a prior contract with the Board;
(2) The bidder defaulted on a contract, thereby requiring the Board to utilize the services of another contractor to provide the goods or perform the services or to correct or complete the contract;
(3) The bidder defaulted on a contract, thereby requiring the Board to look to the bidder’s surety for completion of the contract or tender of the costs of completion; or
(4) The bidder is debarred or suspended from contracting with any of the agencies or departments of the executive branch of the State of New Jersey at the time of the contract award, whether or not the action was based on experience with the Board.
b.
The following conditions apply if the Board is contemplating a disqualification based on prior negative experience:
(1) The existence of any of the indicators of prior negative experience set forth in this section shall not require that a bidder be disqualified.
In each instance, the decision to disqualify shall be made within the discretion of the Board and shall be rendered in the best interests of the Board.
(2) All mitigating factors shall be considered in determining the seriousness of the prior negative experience and in deciding whether disqualification is warranted.
(3) The bidder shall be furnished by the Board with a written notice
(a) Stating that a disqualification is being considered;
(b) Setting forth the reason for the disqualification; and
(c) Indicating that the bidder shall be accorded an opportunity for a hearing before the Board if the bidder so requests within a stated period of time.
At the hearing, the bidder shall show good cause why the bidder should not be disqualified by presenting documents and testimony.
If the Board determines that good cause has not been shown by the bidder, it may vote to find the bidder lacking in responsibility and, thus, disqualified.
(4) Disqualification shall be for a reasonable, defined period of time which shall not exceed five years.
(5) A disqualification, other than a disqualification pursuant to which a Board is prohibited by law from entering into a contract with a bidder, may be voided or the period thereof may be reduced, in the discretion of the Board, upon the submission of a good faith application under oath, supported by documentary evidence, setting forth substantial and appropriate grounds for the granting of relief, such as reversal of a judgment, or actual change of ownership, management or control of the bidder.
(6) An opportunity for a hearing need not be offered to a bidder whose disqualification is based on its suspension or debarment by an agency or department of the executive branch of the State of New Jersey.
The term of such a disqualification shall be concurrent with the term of the suspension or debarment by the State agency or department.
