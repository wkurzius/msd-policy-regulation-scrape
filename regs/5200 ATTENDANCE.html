B.
Unexcused Absences That Count Toward Truancy/Excused Absences for Board Policy
1.
Notwithstanding the requirement of reporting student absences in the school register for State and Federal reporting purposes, “excused” and “unexcused” student absences for the purpose of expectations and consequences regarding truancy, student conduct, promotion, retention, and the award of course credit is a Board decision outlined in Policy 5200 and this Regulation.
2.
N.J.A.C.
6A:16-7.6(a)3 requires the Board of Education policies and procedures contain, at a minimum, a definition of unexcused absence that counts toward truancy, student conduct, promotion, retention, and the award of course credit.

 Other daytime activities unrelated to the school program;

18A:36-14 through 16;
 Participation in observance of Veterans Day, pursuant to N.J.S.A.
18A:36-13.2;
 An absence considered excused by the Commissioner of Education and/or a New Jersey Department of Education rule;
 An absence for a reason not listed above, but deemed excused by the Principal upon a written request by the student’s parent stating the reason for the absence and requesting permission for the absence to be an excused absence;
3.
“Unexcused tardiness” may constitute an unexcused absence that counts toward truancy in accordance with Policy 5240.
C.
Notice to School of a Student’s Absence
1.
The parent or adult student shall notify the school office before the school day when the student will not be in school.

4.
In accordance with N.J.S.A.

D.
Readmission to School After an Absence

A student returning from an absence of any length of time must provide a written statement to the Principal or designee that is dated and signed by the parent or adult student listing the reason for the absence.

Where class participation is a factor in the learning process, the teacher may consider a student’s absence in determining a final grade, except absences for the observance of a religious holiday or absence for a student’s suspension from school will not adversely affect the student’s grade.
The teacher may record an incomplete grade for a student who has not had a full opportunity to make up missed work.
2.
A secondary student may be dropped from a course or denied course credit when the secondary student has been absent from 10 percent or more of the class sessions, whatever the reason for the absence, except that absences for the observance of a religious holiday, absences for those excused in accordance with the reporting requirements of the school register, or absences caused by a student’s suspension will not count toward the total.
