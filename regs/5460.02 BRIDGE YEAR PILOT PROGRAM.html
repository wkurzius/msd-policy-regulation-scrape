Bridge Year Liaisons shall develop, in consultation with Bridge Year students, an Individual Learning Plan (ILP) for each student.

The Bridge Year Liaison:
a.
Shall collect and report attendance in accordance with the school district’s policy for those students participating in classes not at the host high school consistent with N.J.A.C.
6A:16-7.6.
Attendance for classes at the host high school shall be collected and recorded in the normal course;

Must receive reports from the institution of higher education that a Bridge Year student attends at least quarterly.
The reports must demonstrate, in a manner specified by the student’s ILP, the student’s academic progress and performance; and

Be in the graduating classes of 2021 or 2022;

Be nineteen years old or younger during the entirety of the Bridge Year; a student that would turn twenty years old before the end of their Bridge Year is not eligible to participate;

a.
Regarding the Bridge Year’s age requirements in B.1.c.
above, school districts that have students with disabilities who have satisfied their State and local graduation requirements, but may need an extra year of services, and will not turn twenty-one years old before June 30, may receive services for another year as determined by the student’s IEP team, which includes the student and the student’s parent(s).
b.
The school district’s Bridge Year Liaison should collaborate with the student’s IEP team as the services provided to students with disabilities should be focused on transition services.
Services shall be delivered via the IEP.
C.
Academics
1.
Individual Learning Plans (ILP)
a.
Each Bridge Year student’s academic and co-curricular goals for the Bridge Year shall be defined in an ILP.
A student’s ILP shall detail the activities and strategies for accomplishing these goals, including, but not limited to, counseling, academic support, coursework, and                     co-curricular or athletic participation.
The New Jersey Department of Education (NJDOE) developed an ILP template for school districts, which will be available on the NJDOE’s webpage.
(1) In developing a student’s ILP, a school district should utilize the considerations outlined in Bridge Year Pilot Program (P.L.
2020 c.41) Implementation Guidance.
