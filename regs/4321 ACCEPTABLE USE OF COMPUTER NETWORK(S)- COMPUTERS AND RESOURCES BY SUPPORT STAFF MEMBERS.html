While most of the content available on the Internet is innocuous and much of it a valuable educational resource, some objectionable material exists.
The Board will provide pupil access to Internet resources only in supervised environments and has taken steps to lock out objectionable areas to the extent possible, but potential dangers remain.
Support staff members are advised that some systems may contain defamatory, inaccurate, abusive, obscene, profane, sexually oriented, threatening, racially offensive, or otherwise illegal material and are to supervise pupil use of computers and the Internet.
The Board and the system administrators do not condone the use of such materials and do not permit usage of such materials in the school environment.
Support staff members should discipline pupils knowingly bringing such materials into the school environment in accordance with Board policies and regulations and inform pupils that such activities may result in termination of such pupils’ accounts on the computer network(s) and their independent use of computers.
On-line Conduct
Any action by a support staff member or other user of the school district’s computer network(s)/computers that is determined by a system administrator to constitute an inappropriate use of computer network(s)/computers resources or to improperly restrict or inhibit other members from using and enjoying those resources is strictly prohibited and may result in limitation on or termination of an offending member’s account and other action in compliance with the Board policy and regulation.
The user specifically agrees not to submit, publish, or display any defamatory, inaccurate, abusive, obscene, profane, sexually oriented, threatening, racially offensive, or otherwise illegal material; nor shall a user encourage the use, sale, or distribution of controlled substances.

A canceled account will not retain its E-mail.
Members are expected to remove old messages within thirty calendar days or the system administrators may remove such messages.

Security
Security on any computer system is a high priority, especially when the system involves many users.
If a member feels that he/she can identify a security problem on the computer network(s), the member must notify a system administrator.
The member should not inform individuals other than the system administrators or other designated members of the school district staff of a security problem.
Professional staff may allow individuals who are not members to access the system through the staff personal account as long as the staff person does not disclose the password of the account to the individuals and understands that the staff person assumes responsibility for the actions of individuals using his/her account.
Members may not otherwise allow others to use their account and password.
Passwords to the system should not be easily guessable by others, nor should they be words which could be found in a dictionary.
Attempts to log in to the system using either another member’s account or as a system administrator will result in termination of the account.
Members should immediately notify a system administrator if a password is lost or stolen, or if they have reason to believe that someone has obtained unauthorized access to their account.
Any member identified as a security risk will have limitations placed on usage of the computer network(s)/computers or may be terminated as a user and be subject to other disciplinary action.
