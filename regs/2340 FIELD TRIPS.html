In addition to the regulations set forth in the Board of Education Policy 2340, the following should be noted:
1.
Only trips that are closely tied to the curriculum and that have measured results and assessments should be considered:
a.
The limit for each teacher is one trip per course per semester during the school day;
b.
Field trips can be arranged for an evening, a holiday, a Saturday, or a Sunday; and
c.
All field trips, including overnight field trips, must be approved by the Board of Education.
2.
Pupils are responsible for making up any work they miss due to a field trip.
a.
Teachers taking pupils on field trips should remind students that they are responsible for making up any work they may miss; and
b.
Pupils are to follow the rules set forth by the supervising teacher as well as school rules.
3.
Teachers must follow the steps below to have a field trip approved:
a.
A Field Trip Application, a Special Events Transportation request, and a Building Use form (if the trip is outside the normal school day) must be completed and submitted to the administrator for approval.
These forms are located in the Main Office or online.
If there is a change in the date/time/location, the Main Office must be notified;
b.
Pupil permission slips are due to the teacher in charge of the trip at least seven days before the trip.
Pupil permission slips are available in the Main office.
One copy of each permission slip must be filed in the Main Office prior to embarking on the trip with a copy given to all chaperones;
c.
A list of pupils attending the trip should be e-mailed to all staff at least five days before the trip.
Pupils must have returned their permission slips to be on this list.
The list should include the date of the trip, times leaving and returning, destination, and teacher(s);
d.
The teacher/advisor in charge of the trip must submit an updated copy of the list of pupils and current contact information of the teacher/advisor in charge of planning the field trip to the building administrator's secretary before leaving on the trip;
e.
Teachers and pupils must use the transportation provided by the school;
f.
Teachers in charge of the trip must accompany the pupils on the bus to and from the trip.
They may not "meet" pupils there or leave parents in charge; and
g.
Check the calendar in each school's office and the district calendar when scheduling dates for trips.
h.
All overnight field trips must confirm, by application and in consultation with the Principal designee, the procurement of security personnel/nurse to monitor the students’ residence during the overnight.
The hotel establishment/dorm may provide the security or if not available security will be secured by the trip advisor in consultation with the Principal or designee.
The cost of security is to be incorporated into the cost of the trip.
i.
The Manville Police Department is to be notified of all walking trips within the Borough of Manville.
4.
To maximize pupil and teacher in-class time and to prevent disruption near the end of report card periods, the following limitations will govern the scheduling of field trips:
a.
No trips will be scheduled during the last week of each marking period, during State Assessments, five school days before exams begin, or during exams;
b.
The building administrator may limit the number of trips per teacher where a teacher's classes must be covered.
The building administrator will consider the total picture of the teacher attendance in making such decisions;                                                                                          
c.
The number of trips in a week or on a given day will be carefully monitored with the goal being to keep the number of pupils and teachers out on trips to a reasonable number;
d.
The limit for each teacher is one trip per course per semester during the school day;
e.
Field trips, which are included in the written course of study or have a community service component and/or are competition based, will receive preference over others; and
f.
All field trips, including overnight field trips, must be approved by the Board of Education;
g.
There must be three months notice for all field trips with approval  
from the Manville Board of Education.
Consideration for exemption  
to the identified time constraint of three months will be contingent upon approval of the Superintendent.
h.
Senior class and eighth grade class trips must be presented to the   
Superintendent by the end of September for inclusion on the October 
Board of Education agenda.
Adequate supervision for pupils on a field trip is a must.
Teachers must take additional adult chaperones.
(Parent(s) or legal guardian(s) may be used to chaperone).
The administrator, in consultation with the teacher making the requests (a ratio of one chaperone to eight pupils is ideal), will determine the minimum number of chaperones for a field trip.
This number may fluctuate due to the nature of the trip and the age of the pupils (administrative decision).
Children of faculty and staff members serving as chaperones on the field trip are not permitted to participate.
A certified nurse should accompany all overnight trips to ensure all medications are properly dispensed to pupils at an overnight rate of $200.00 per night.
In any case where a certified nurse is not available, alternate means of ensuring the dispersion of medication will be developed to include mailing medication and doctor's orders to the location of the overnight stay for dispersion by certified personnel, securing the services from a medical nursing service, requiring the pupil's parent(s) or legal guardian(s) to accompany the trip, or allowing the pupil to self-administer the medication following all district and legal protocols and with parent/guardian permission.
Failure of the pupil and/or parent/guardian to notify the responsible staff member (advisor, nurse and/or Principal) of their need for medication may result in their denial of participation on the trip.
Pupil attendance on a field trip is a privilege.
Therefore, pupils may be barred from participating by either the teacher taking the trip or the administration.
The teacher will make the recommendation to the Principal or designee.
Reasons for barring a pupil include behavior problems, poor attendance, or poor academic record.
The teacher, however, must provide an alternate assignment for the pupils not permitted to go on the trip.
Pupils may use the regular appeals process when barred from a trip.
If a child is excluded from a trip for academic, discipline, or attendance reasons there will not be a refund.
If a pupil is unable to participate in a trip for economic reasons, arrangements will be made for trips that are directly related to the curriculum.
The Board may occasionally approve a trip that is not directly related and in this case this paragraph shall not apply.
Pupils will have had the ability to raise money for trips through organized fundraisers and other school activities.
As representatives of the Manville School District, pupils on field trips are expected to exhibit exemplary behavior and dress.
A pupil who misbehaves on a trip will be written up.
Sanctions may include social probation, which would bar the offending pupil from any further field trips.
