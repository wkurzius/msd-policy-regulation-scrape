b.
That it does not demand extensive analysis.
c.
That it substantially limits one major life activity, but not necessarily other major life activities.
d.
That it may be episodic or in remission, as long as the disability would substantially limit a major life activity when active.
e.
That it need not prevent, or significantly or severely restrict, an individual from performing a major life activity.
f.
That it requires an individualized assessment which does not create an “inappropriately high level of limitation” and is based upon the conditions, manner, or duration under which the individual can perform the major life activity    42 U.S.C.
12102(4)(B).
g.
That it generally will not require scientific, medical, or statistical evidence (although such evidence can be required where appropriate - evidence that can be considered may include statements or affidavits of affected individuals and school records).
h.
That the determination is made without regard to ameliorative effects of mitigating measures, except for the use of ordinary eyeglasses or contact lenses intended to fully correct visual acuity or eliminate refractive error.
Non-ameliorative effects, such as the negative side effects of medication or a medical procedure, may also be considered.
i.
That the effects of an impairment lasting or expected to last less than six months can be substantially limiting for establishing a disability under the first two prongs:  “actual disability” or “record of”.

Evaluation and Placement - 34 CFR §104.35
1.
The Board will establish standards and procedures for initial evaluations and periodic re-evaluations of students who need or are believed to need special education and/or related services on the basis of disability.
a.
Section 504 evaluations may encompass record and work sample review; direct observation in the natural setting; interviews with the student, parent, and school personnel; and/or administration of assessment measures.
They do not include independent evaluations.
b.
It may be determined that additional data is required, including the administration of formal standardized instruments and data on conditions in remission or episodic in nature.
Tests and other evaluation materials must meet the following criteria:
(1) Validated for the specific purpose for which they are used and administered by trained personnel;
(2) Tailored to assess specific areas of educational need and not merely those designed to provide a single intelligence quotient; and
(3) Accurately reflect aptitude or achievement or whatever else the tests purport to measure, rather than the student’s impaired sensory, manual, or speaking skills (unless the test is designed to measure these particular factors).
2.
In interpreting evaluation data and in making placement decisions, the district will:
a.
Draw information from a variety of sources, including, but not limited to:  aptitude and achievement tests, medical evaluations, teacher recommendations, physical condition, social and cultural background, and adaptive behavior;

2.
A referral for a Section 504 evaluation may be made concurrently with a pending special education evaluation.
In such instances, the Section 504 evaluation should be conducted during the same timeline utilized for the special education assessment.
Generally, the Section 504 evaluation should be conducted in less than sixty days.
3.
If a student is found eligible under Section 504 prior to the special education team’s findings, a Section 504 Accommodation Plan will be developed pending the special education team’s findings.
If the student is then found eligible for special education, an Individualized Education Program (IEP) will be developed and the IEP team can incorporate into the IEP any accommodations/services provided in the Section 504 Accommodation Plan.
4.
A separate Section 504 team meeting will be convened when a student is identified as eligible for special education and no longer requires accommodations/services under Section 504.
5.
When an IEP team determines a student is not eligible or no longer eligible for special education, there may be circumstances when a Section 504 referral for evaluation may be appropriate and should be considered.
The IEP team may document the student is being referred for a Section 504 evaluation, and the eligibility evaluation shall be addressed in a separate Section 504 team meeting.
G.
Section 504 Accommodation Plan
1.
The District 504 Coordinator will assist in organizing a team of individuals responsible for receiving referral documents; securing evaluation information; and determining eligibility and appropriate accommodations, related aids or services for eligible students with disabilities.
The team must be comprised of people who:
a.
Are knowledgeable about the student;
b.
Understand the meaning of evaluation data; and
c.
Are familiar with placement options.
2.
The District 504 Coordinator, based on the evaluation of the student eligible for services under Section 504, will prepare a Section 504 Accommodation Plan which may include as relates to the student:

c.
Current educational placement;

Accommodation (as appropriate):

(2) Certification by the student’s parent that he or she has participated in the development of the plan and provided consent to its implementation.

a.
Modify the curriculum;
b.
Exempt a student from a course or subject required for graduation;
c.
Alter the level of expectation for a student’s performance;
d.
Provide an extended time accommodation only for standardized testing when it is not required as part of the regular program of evaluation;

5.
Students needing medication:
a.
Not all students needing medication administered by school staff will require a Section 504 Accommodation Plan.
It is not necessary to qualify a student as having a disability that substantially limits a major life activity under Section 504 in order to provide a service that schools perform for all general education students.
b.
A Section 504 referral with the potential for a subsequent Section 504 Accommodation Plan is appropriate when a student is found to have a disability that substantially limits a major life activity and needs medication administered on a systematic basis to receive equal access to the educational program.
H.
Nonacademic/Extracurricular Services - 34 CFR §104.37
1.
Nonacademic and Extracurricular Services may include counseling, physical recreational athletics, transportation, health services, recreational activities, special interest groups or school clubs, and/or referrals to agencies which provide assistance to students with disabilities and student employment.
