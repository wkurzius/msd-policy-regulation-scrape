Section: Students
Date Created: October 2009
Date Edited: September 2020
The Board of Education shall recognize pupils where appropriate in the areas of academic, athletic and service excellence.
Academic 
The Board of Education shall recognize outstanding pupil accomplishments through the use of an honor and high honor roll for pupils in grades three through twelve.
The Board shall also sponsor an Honor Society for pupils in grades eleven and twelve.
When pupils achieve other honors or awards, they may be invited in front of the Board for special recognition.
A Senior Awards Night will be held to present scholarships and awards to "upper classmen."  Other recognition will be accomplished at separate pupil recognition programs.
Athletic 
The Board of Education will field a variety of athletic teams to meet the needs of the pupils.
When the high school fields a Board sponsored varsity team there shall be several awards.
Each team will have an MVP award, a coach's award, a most improved athlete award and a scholar-athlete award.
There shall be no other awards sponsored by the school.
If a team wins a conference or a county or State championship, they will be recognized at a Board of Education meeting.
Each participant will receive a plaque outlining the team's accomplishments, a certificate of achievement and this accomplishment will go on a banner to be hung in the high school gymnasium.
(The scholar-athlete award will be given to a pupil who has an earned varsity letter for that season and has the highest GPA on the team for that season.) 
Awards Presentation 
There will be an awards presentation at the end of each season that will be sponsored by the school.
Any club/activity/sport sponsoring a dinner or program will not charge invited guests more than the per person cost of that event.
Service 
School service groups shall be recognized by the Board in order to emphasize the importance of citizenship.
If any pupil performs community service to a degree that is above and beyond all expectations, they will be recognized by the Board at a meeting and receive a certificate.
