5331  - MANAGEMENT OF LIFE-THREATENING ALLERGIES IN SCHOOLS (M)
Section: Students
Date Created: October 2009
Date Edited: October 2009
M
A.
Definitions
1.
Anaphylaxis - A serious allergic reaction that is rapid in onset and may cause death.
2.
Epinephrine (adrenaline) - A drug that can be successfully utilized to counteract anaphylaxis.
3.
Food Allergy - A group of disorders characterized by immunologic responses to specific food proteins.
In the United States, the most likely common allergens in adults and children are cow’s milk, eggs, peanuts, wheat, soy, fish, shellfish, and nuts.
4.
Individualized Emergency Healthcare Plan (IEHP) - A personalized healthcare plan written by the certified school nurse that specifies the delivery of accommodations and services needed by a pupil in the event of an emergency.
5.
Individualized Healthcare Plan (IHP) - A plan written by the certified school nurse that details accommodations and/or nursing services to be provided to a pupil because of the pupil’s medical condition based on medical orders written by a health care provider in the pupil’s medical home.
6.
School-Sponsored Function - Any activity, event, or program occurring on or off school grounds, whether during or outside of regular school hours, that is organized and/or supported by the school.
B.
Policy and Regulation Development 
1.
Policy and Regulation 5331 address different allergens, varying ages and maturity levels of pupils, and the physical properties and organizational structures of schools in this school district.
The components below were critical in developing Policy and Regulation 5331.
a.
The school district nursing staff, in consultation with the school physician, if needed:
(1) Assessed the overall health needs of the pupil population at risk for anaphylaxis, particularly pupils with food allergies; and
(2) Assessed current and relevant policies and/or protocols regarding the care of pupils with life-threatening allergies and identified areas in need of development or improvement.
2.
Policy and Regulation 5331 were developed using a multidisciplinary team that included various school district administrators, teachers, and support staff members.
3.
Additional factors need to be regarded at the secondary school level in order to provide the best care for food-allergic teens.
The multidisciplinary team should consider the factors below when developing Policy and Regulation 5331 as it pertains to food-allergic teens.
a.
Pupils move to different classrooms, frequently in larger buildings and campuses, presenting needs for updated avoidance strategies, epinephrine availability, and designated assistance.
b.
Pupils may have open lunch periods and accompany friends to local eateries.
c.
Pupils may have access to vending machines.
d.
Certain classes give rise to new avoidance issues, e.g., chemistry/biology labs, home economics/culinary class, etc.
e.
The number of off-site school-sponsored functions increases, e.g., travel, sometimes to other States and foreign countries; athletic games and competitions, sometimes in other towns; dances; etc.
f.
Risk-taking behaviors frequently accompany the independence of adolescent years.
g.
N.J.S.A.
18A:40-12.6 provides for a delegate for the emergency administration of epinephrine even when a pupil is able to self-administer life-saving medication.
Although teenage pupils will more than likely be permitted to carry and self-administer emergency medications, those pupils are not to be expected to have complete responsibility for the administration of epinephrine.
A severe allergic reaction can completely incapacitate a pupil and inhibit the ability to self-administer emergency medication.
Therefore, the school nurse or volunteer delegate shall be available during school and school-sponsored functions to administer epinephrine in an emergency in accordance with the provisions of N.J.S.A.
18A:40-12.5.e.(2).
4.
The Principal and/or the school nurse will educate staff and the community regarding Policy and Regulation 5331; obtain feedback on the implementation and effectiveness of the Policy and Regulation; and annually review, evaluate, and update the Policy and Regulation, as needed or required by law.
C.
Prevention Measures
1.
Considerations for the Cafeteria
The Principal, in consultation with the school nurse, teaching staff members, food service staff members, and other appropriate staff members, will work to make the cafeteria environment as safe as possible for food-allergic pupils.
This process includes making determinations about serving foods with known allergens and identifying steps that can be taken to reduce the chance of accidental exposure.
The steps may include:
a.
Training to food service personnel on food label reading and safe handling, as well as safe meal substitutions for food-allergic children.
b.
Educating cafeteria staff and monitors about food-allergy management and make them aware of the pupils who have life-threatening food allergies.
c.
Developing and implementing standard procedures for cleaning tables, chairs, and trays, particularly those designated as allergen-safe, after lunch periods using dedicated and disposable supplies to avoid cross contact.
d.
When possible, sharing ingredient/allergen information for food provided by the school to pupils and parent(s) or legal guardian(s).
e.
Making allergen-safe table(s) an available option for allergic pupils.

h.
Encouraging pupils to wash hands before and after eating.
i.
Considering the benefits and ramifications of serving and/or removing allergen-containing foods or removing a particular food item from the school menu.
j.
Making accommodations in the event a pupil cannot be in direct proximity to certain allergens that are being cooked/boiled/steamed.
2.
Considerations for the Classroom
Provisions will be made to develop safeguards for the protection of food-allergic pupils in the classroom.
The school nurse will work with the classroom teacher(s) so the teacher understands and is able to initiate the pupil’s IEHP, as necessary.
a.
If possible, consider prohibiting the use or consumption of allergen-containing foods in the classroom.
b.
Conduct training for teachers, aides, volunteers, substitutes, and pupils about food allergies.
c.
Develop and implement a procedure that will alert substitute teachers to the presence of any pupils with food allergies and any accompanying instructions.

h.
Encourage pupils to wash hands before and after eating.
i.
Develop and implement standard procedures for cleaning desks, tables, and the general classroom area.
3.
General Considerations for the School Environment 
The Principal, in consultation with the school nurse, teaching staff members, food service staff members, and other appropriate staff members, will work to make the school environment as safe as possible for the food-allergic pupil to include:
a.
Developing and implementing cleaning procedures for common areas (i.e., libraries, computer labs, music and art rooms, hallways, etc.).
b.
Developing and implementing guidelines for food fundraisers (i.e.
bake sales, candy sales, etc.) that are held on school grounds.
c.
Avoiding the use of food products as displays or components of displays in hallways.
d.
Developing protocols for appropriate cleaning methods following events held at the school, which involve food.
4.
Field Trips and Other School Functions
N.J.S.A.
