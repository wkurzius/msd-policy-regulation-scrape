Analysis of Absence
1.
Each intended absence of a support staff member shall be reported to his/her immediate supervisor, who shall determine whether or not a replacement is required for the period of absence.

A pattern of absences before or after nonworking days;
c.
The exhaustion or near exhaustion of accumulated sick leave; and
d.
The habitual exhaustion of personal leave.
C.
Review of Absence
1.
If the immediate supervisor deems any reason for absence to be unacceptable or if a staff member has been absent on sick leave more than three consecutive school days, the immediate supervisor shall conduct an informal discussion with the employee to help the employee improve his/her performance.
The supervisor shall keep a record of this conference.
2.
If the abuse of absence continues the immediate supervisor shall:
a.
Notify the employee in writing of the date and time for a formal conference and the reason for the conference,
b.
Confer with the employee and, if the employee so chooses, his/her representative as well,
c.
Document the reasons for the absences and offer the employee the opportunity to verify or rebut the documentation, and

A record shall be kept of the attendance of each support staff member, including administrators.
Any absence, for part or all of a school day, shall be recorded along with the reason for the absence.
An employee’s attendance record shall be part of the employee’s personnel file.
2.
The record will distinguish paid leave, such as sick leave, personal days, family illness, jury duty, and vacation, from unpaid leave, such as excessive sick or personal leave.
The employee’s attendance record will include notation of verification of an absence where such verification is required by Policy No.
4432.
3.
The record will include each employee’s rate of absence as calculated annually.

The Principal shall be responsible for implementing the approved plan for the improvement of staff member attendance in his/her school building.

Inform employees of Board policy and district regulations on attendance;

Familiarize employees with the procedures to be used in reporting and verifying absences;
3.
Review with employees the cost of absenteeism to the district and the value of accumulated sick leave to the employee; and
