Fire Drills
1.
The Principal of each school building will conduct at least one fire drill each month within school hours, including any summer months during which the school is open for instructional programs.
The Principal shall require all teachers to keep all doors and exits of their respective rooms and buildings unlocked during school hours.
Where school buildings have been provided with fire escapes, they shall be used by a part or all of the students performing every fire drill.
Attempts should be made to conduct drills in various weather conditions and at various times of the school day.
Fire drills should be unannounced to school staff and students.
The Principal shall inform local firefighting officials whenever a fire alarm is for drill purposes.
An actual fire that occurs at a school building during the month and includes activities which are the equivalent of a drill shall be considered a drill for the purposes of meeting the requirements of this Regulation and N.J.S.A.
18A:41-1.
2.
The fire alarm shall be by a building-wide audible signal.
Alarm signals should be tested regularly
3.
When the fire alarm rings, each staff member supervising students will: 
a.
Direct students to form into a single file line and proceed along the evacuation route to the nearest exit designated for evacuation;
b.
Close the windows of the room and turn off all lights and audio-visual equipment;
c.
Take the class register or roll book;
d.
Ascertain that all students have left the room and that any student who may have left the classroom prior to the fire drill is located and escorted from the building;
e.
Close all doors to the room when the room is empty and keep all doors and exits of their respective rooms and buildings unlocked;
f.
Ensure their assigned students have left the school along the route prescribed in the school evacuation plan.
In the event a school building has been provided with fire escapes, they shall be used by a part or all of the students performing every fire drill;
g.
Direct students to a location not less than a distance twice the height of the building walls and keep the students in a single file line facing the building;
h.
Take attendance to determine all students who reported to class have been evacuated from the building and report immediately to the Principal any student who is unaccounted for; and 
i.
When the recall signal is given, conduct students back to the classroom.
4.
Evacuation of the school in a fire drill must be conducted quickly and quietly and in an orderly fashion.
Students must be silent, refrain from talking and running, and remain in closed, single file lines.
Any student or staff member whose behavior disrupts the conduct of the fire drill shall be reported to the Principal and will be subject to discipline.
5.
All persons in the school must leave the building during a fire drill, including all aides, visitors, volunteer workers, and all office, cafeteria, custodial, and maintenance employees, except those employees who have been assigned specific duties to be performed in the school building during a fire drill.
6.
Physical education classes in progress outside the building should stop the game activity and line up in place or in their regularly assigned drill position.
7.
Students will be instructed not to gather belongings to take outside on the fire drill.
In inclement or cold weather, students may pick up their coats and put them on as they exit the building, provided no time is lost in that activity.
8.
The office employee responsible for keeping the central attendance register, or a designated substitute, must carry the register out of the building during the drill.
9.
Each Principal shall report monthly to the Superintendent on the conduct of fire drills.
Their report will include the date, weather conditions, and time to evacuate for each drill conducted, as well as any comments that could assist in improving the conduct of future drills.
10.
Every fire drill will be conducted with seriousness and with the assumption that prompt evacuation is actually required for the safety and survival of persons in the school.
11.
Principals are encouraged to change the circumstances of fire drills so that staff members and students are subjected to various conditions and learn to respond to them quickly, constructively, and safely.
Any such variations should take into account the ages and abilities of children.
a.
One or more exits may be designated as “blocked” so that students are required to use alternative evacuation routes.
b.
A fire drill may be designated as a “smoke drill” so that students learn to avoid the hazards of smoke by walking in a low or crouching position (not a crawling position).
B.
Fire
1.
A school staff member or any building occupant who detects a fire in a school building or on school grounds shall immediately report the fire by calling 911 and/or by activating a fire alarm pull station in accordance with law.
2.
The school staff member or building occupant shall also report the fire to the school Principal, if possible.
3.
In the event of a fire in a school building, the school Principal shall immediately sound the fire alarm, in the event the fire alarm had not been previously activated, for the evacuation of all students, staff members, visitors, and volunteers.
4.
Evacuation shall be conducted in accordance with the fire drill procedures established in A.
above, except that no employee may remain in the building to perform specific duties.
5.
As a precaution, the Principal or designee will maintain a record of disabled students who may require special attention in the event of fire or other evacuation.
Fire fighters will be promptly informed of the location and special circumstances of each such student.
6.
As soon as practicable after the incident, the Principal shall submit a report to the Superintendent on the appropriate form.
7.
The school district shall immediately notify the appropriate local fire department of any fire which occurs in a school building or on school property in accordance with N.J.S.A.
18A:41-5.
C.

Every Principal and custodian/janitor in each school building in the district which has a furnace room, hallway, or stair-tower fire or smoke doors shall keep them closed during the time the school building is occupied by teachers and students pursuant to N.J.S.A.
