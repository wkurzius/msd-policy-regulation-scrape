A.
Content of Homework
1.
Any homework assigned to pupils must be closely integrated with the curriculum.
There should be a direct relationship between classroom studies and assigned homework.
Homework should reinforce and extend the lessons learned in school.
2.
Homework should help pupils learn by providing practice in the mastery of skills, experience in gathering information and integrating knowledge, and an opportunity to remediate learning problems.
3.
Homework should help develop the pupil's responsibility and provide an opportunity for the pupil to exercise independent work and judgment.
4.
The concepts on which a homework assignment is based should have been thoroughly taught and reviewed in class.
Homework assignments should include only those exercises and activities that a pupil can accomplish independently.
5.
Homework assignments should not require the use of research or resource tools that are not readily available in the pupils’ homes or in sufficient quantity in the public or school library, or available for borrowing from the classroom.
6.
Homework assignments should not require extensive copy work unless the writing of numbers or script is the skill being taught.
7.
Homework must never serve a punitive or disciplinary function; learning, in school or at home, must always be a positive experience, rewarding for its own sake.
B.
Assignment of Homework
1.
The number, frequency, and degree of difficulty of homework assignments should be based on the ability and needs of the individual pupil.
2.
Homework should be assigned with clarity so that pupils know precisely what is expected of them.
It may be helpful for teachers to post the homework assignment at the beginning of the class period and to encourage pupils to ask questions about any aspect of the assignment they do not fully understand.
Homework should never be assigned hurriedly or in a confused manner.
3.
Teachers should observe the following guidelines for the introduction and assignment of homework.
Time allotments include all aspects of the homework assignment--outside reading, research, drill work, and the like.
a.
Kindergarten
Home experiences related to classroom lessons should be assigned to pupils when appropriate.
b.
Grades 1, 2, and 3
Formal homework assignments should be introduced in grade one.
Lessons should be geared to the needs and abilities of individual pupils.
The amount of time allocated should increase through the grades from fifteen to thirty minutes several times a week.
c.
Grades 4 and 5
Homework should be regularly scheduled, should require no more than sixty minutes of preparation daily, and should be based on the needs and abilities of individual pupils.
d.
Grades 6, 7, and 8
Homework should be regularly scheduled, should require no more than ninety minutes of preparation daily, and should be based on the needs and abilities of individual pupils.
In departmentalized junior high or elementary grades, pupils’ total daily homework load and out-of-school responsibilities should be considered in determining the amount of homework to be assigned.
Teachers on each grade level or team will meet once a week or as required to review time estimates of homework to be assigned.
Major tests that require substantial periods of study will be taken into consideration in determining the total estimated homework load.
e.
Grades 9 through 12
High school pupils should be assigned homework in each major academic subject on a regular basis.
Periodic assignments should be given in art and music courses.
Both long and short term assignments should be given in all courses.
A high school pupil should typically devote at least one hundred twenty minutes to home study on school nights.
Pupils may choose to spend time during weekends and vacation periods on long term assignments.
4.
To the degree reasonably possible, teachers should plan and announce homework assignments, especially long term assignments, well in advance so that pupils can adjust their schedules appropriately.
5.
Pupils should be encouraged or required to maintain a homework assignment book, in which the pupil records his/her daily assignment.
Pupils and parent(s) or legal guardian(s) may be asked to record the time necessary to complete each assignment; this information will assist teachers in verifying their estimates of the length of time a given assignment will require.
6.
A teacher may accede to a parent(s) or legal guardian(s) request for additional homework assignments for a pupil, provided the teacher, in his/her discretion, believes that the pupil will benefit from the assignment.
7.
A pupil who has been absent from school will be given an opportunity to make up homework assignments, provided the assignments are completed during a period equal to the length of his/her absence.
That period may be extended for the completion of long term assignments.
8.
The parent(s) or legal guardian(s) of an absent pupil may request homework assignments to be completed during the pupil's absence.
Teachers are expected to comply with any such request.
C.
Evaluation/Grading of Homework
1.
All homework must be evaluated by the teacher and the teacher's evaluation must be communicated to the pupil.
Homework is not a learning activity if the pupil receives no acknowledgment of his/her work and no appraisal or criticism of it.
2.
Teachers should insist on high standards of quality in homework.
The homework lesson should teach the values of thorough preparation, careful research, neat execution, thoughtful work, and prompt submission.
3.
Homework will count for no more than 10% of a student’s grade.
Although the component of a long term assignment, project/ research paper may count toward the homework grade the overall assignment may count for an additional portion of the student’s grade.
Teachers should develop long term assignments with benchmarks for students and monitor the student’s progress throughout the process.
4.
Quizzes and tests are not to be assigned for homework.
D.
