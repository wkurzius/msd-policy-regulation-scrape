9324  - SEX OFFENDER REGISTRATION AND NOTIFICATION
Section: Community
Date Created: October 2009
Date Edited: October 2009
A.
Definitions
1.
Tier One Offender - An offender that is a “low risk of re-offense”, thus constituting a low risk of harm to the community.
This offender is one who, because of the type of crime, the lack of violence in his/her behavior, the lack of a substantial criminal history and the existence of ties to the community presents no more than a possible risk of re-offense.
2.
Tier Two Offender - An offender who is a “moderate risk of re-offense”, thus constituting a moderate risk of harm to the community in that the pertinent documents demonstrate that they are reasonably likely to re-offend, warranting limited notice for the protection of the public.
3.
Tier Three Offender - An offender who is a “high risk of re-offense” in that the available record demonstrates that there is a probable risk of re-offense, warranting notice to the community likely to encounter the offender.
4.
Likely To Encounter - Law enforcement agencies, community organizations or members of the community who are in a location or in close geographic proximity to a location which the offender visits or can be presumed to visit on a regular basis.
5.
Fair Chance to Encounter - The types of interaction which ordinarily occur at that location and other attendant circumstances demonstrate that contact with the offender is reasonably certain.
B.
Notification To School District From the Law Enforcement Agency/County Prosecutor’s Office
1.
The Superintendent and the Building Principal(s) of the targeted schools will be notified by the Prosecutor’s Office, without the need to register to be notified, for all sex offenders classified as Tier Two or Tier Three Offenders.
Local law enforcement agencies and/or the County Prosecutor’s Office will determine there is a “fair chance to encounter” the offender in determining community notification.
In any event the Superintendent and the Building Principal(s) will be notified for all Tier Two and Tier Three Offenders.
2.
The Building Principal(s) are entitled to receive the offender’s name and a recent photograph, along with a physical description, the offense of which he/she was convicted, their address, place of employment and/or schooling, and vehicle license number.
3.
The County Prosecutor’s Office determines the specific schools, community organizations and residences to receive notification.
4.
The County Prosecutor’s Office and/or the appropriate law enforcement office will notify the Superintendent and the Principal of the targeted school(s).
The Superintendent should not notify the target school(s), but may contact the Prosecutor’s Office if the Superintendent thinks that a school in the notification area has been inadvertently omitted.
C.
School District Procedure Upon Notification From the Law Enforcement Agency/County Prosecutor’s Office
1.
The Building Principal(s) will have the discretion to make the determination as to which employees within the school should be informed of the notification.
The Building Principal should share the notice with any person who in the course of the duties of his/her employment or assignment is regularly in a position to observe unauthorized persons in or near the property of the notified school.
If any persons to be notified by the Building Principal are employees of private contractors, the Principal or the Superintendent will notify the private vendor who will provide notice to the employees.
The Building Principal will take appropriate steps to educate and alert those staff members who are charged with the care and supervision of children, emphasizing that this information is intended to assist staff members in the protection of their charges, not to provide notification to the community at large.
2.
The Building Principal, in conjunction with the appropriate law enforcement agency and the County Prosecutor’s Office will provide information, along with appropriate advice regarding the safeguarding of the school’s children.
3.
All school district staff are prohibited from releasing any of this information to the public at large.
All inquiries from community members, non-affected school staff, all parent(s) or legal guardian(s) and other members of the general public shall be directed to the appropriate law enforcement agency and/or the County Prosecutor’s Office.
