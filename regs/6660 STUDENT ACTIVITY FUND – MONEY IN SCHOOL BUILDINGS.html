6660  - STUDENT ACTIVITY FUND â€“ MONEY IN SCHOOL BUILDINGS
Section: Finances
Date Created: October 2009
Date Edited: October 2009
The Board of Education recognizes the need for schools to collect and transmit money, make minor cash payments, and hold money in trust for groups, activities, or projects associated with them.
Accordingly, it establishes the following policies:
1.
Responsibility:  The Principal of each school building is responsible for the careful and businesslike handling of money within the school building or in his/her custody and control;
2.
Handling of Cash and Checks:  Schools are discouraged from keeping cash and checks within the building.
Necessary cash and checks should be kept locked in a vault, safe, or cash box.
Cash and checks not needed for immediate payments should be deposited in a bank.
Any receipts in excess of $100.00 will be turned into the Board of Education office that day.
All checks should be deposited as they are received.
If they are not, the staff member or administrator who held on to the money will be responsible for any missing monies;
3.
Establishing an Internal Account:  Each school may establish an "Internal Account" at Commerce Bank.
This account will be under the immediate control of the school Principal and in cases where the average monthly balance exceeds $500.00, will require his/her signature and that of another responsible employee with knowledge of the fiscal affairs of the school.
The Principal is responsible for reconciling the bank account each month;
4.
Maintaining Records for Specific Organizations, Activities, and/or Purposes:  The Principal must maintain a general ledger and record all transactions in it.
A separate fund should be created for each activity, organization or purpose represented in the internal account.
These funds generally fall into one of the following categories:
a.
Clearing accounts:  Money collected and held for the Board of Education and other organizations that must be turned over to such agencies in the exact amount collected.
Milk receipts, PTA dues, book fines, etc.
would be recorded here;
b.
Pupil and/or faculty activity accounts:  Money collected by and for eventual use by the individuals or group that collected it.
Club or class dues, yearbook and class ring payments, and proceeds of fund raising events would be recorded here; and
c.
Petty cash fund:  Money advanced to the school and used for immediate payments of comparatively small amounts.
Collect postage or freight, school sponsored field trip fees, and minor approved purchases should be recorded here.
5.
Accounting for Receipts and Disbursements:  All receipts should be acknowledged with a duplicate receipt and posted in the ledger.
A copy of the receipt and other support documentation about the deposit should be kept on file;
6.
Fees, Fines, Deposits, and Other Collections:  Fees, fines, charges, and deposits should only be collected from pupils when authorized by the Board of Education.
These funds must be transmitted to the regular accounts of the Board and not diverted to any other purpose;
7.
Purchases and Other Expenditures:  Principals are responsible for ascertaining that expenditures from internal accounts comply with the Public School Contracts Law and Board policy, and adequately protect the interests of the various individuals, groups, and agencies which provided the funds.
Expenditures for goods or services for curricular or classroom use ordinarily supplied by the Board are forbidden.
No merchandising accommodations, credit, loans, or check cashing is permitted;
8.
School Discretionary Fund:  The Board of Education recognizes that certain projects within schools (soda machines, etc.) may result in a small profit.
The school Principal may use this money for discretionary purchases of supplies or services exclusively for student body use; and
9.
Auditing:  Internal accounts will be audited each year at the same time as other accounts of the Board of Education.
