Eligibility to Attend School – Students Domiciled in the District
1.
A student over five and under twenty years of age pursuant to N.J.S.A.
18A:38-1, or such younger or older student as is otherwise entitled by law to a free public education, is eligible to attend school in this school district if the student is domiciled within the district:
a.
A student is domiciled in the school district when he or she is living with a parent or guardian whose domicile is located within the school district.
(1) When a student’s parents or guardians are domiciled within different school districts and there is no court order or written agreement between the parents designating the school district of attendance, the student’s domicile is the school district of the parent or guardian with whom the student lives for the majority of the school year.
This provision shall apply regardless of which parent has legal custody.
(2) When a student’s physical custody is shared on an equal-time, alternating week/month or other similar basis so the student is not living with one parent or guardian for a majority of the school year and there is no court order or written agreement between the parents designating the school district of attendance, the student’s domicile is the present domicile of the parent or guardian with whom the student resided on the last school day prior to October 16 preceding the application date.
(a) When a student resided with both parents or guardians, or with neither parent or guardian, on the last school day prior to the preceding October 16, the student’s domicile is the domicile of the parent or guardian with whom the parents or guardians indicate the student will be residing on the last school day prior to the ensuing October 16.
When the parents or guardians do not designate or cannot agree upon the student’s likely residence as of that date, or if on that date the student is not residing with the parent or guardian previously indicated, the student shall attend school in the school district of domicile of the parent or guardian with whom the student actually lives as of the last school day prior to October 16.
(b) When the domicile of the student with disabilities as defined in N.J.A.C.
6A:14 cannot be determined pursuant to N.J.A.C.
6A:22-3.1, nothing shall preclude an equitable determination of shared responsibility for the cost of such student’s out-of-district placement.
(3) When a student is living with a person other than a parent or guardian, nothing in N.J.A.C.
6A:22-3.1 is intended to limit the student’s right to attend school in the parent or guardian’s school district of domicile pursuant to the provisions of N.J.A.C.
6A:22.
(4) No school district shall be required to provide transportation for a student residing outside the school district for all or part of the school year unless transportation is based upon the home of the parent or guardian domiciled within the school district or otherwise required by law.
b.
A student is domiciled in the school district when he or she has reached the age of eighteen or is emancipated from the care and custody of a parent or guardian and has established a domicile within the school district.
c.
A student is domiciled in the school district when the student has come from outside the State and is living with a person domiciled in the school district who will be applying for guardianship of the student upon expiration of the six-month “waiting period” of State residency required pursuant to N.J.S.A.
2A:34-54 (“home state” definition) and 2A:34-65.a(1).
However, a student may later be subject to removal proceedings if application for guardianship is not made within a reasonable period of time following expiration of the mandatory waiting period or if guardianship is applied for and denied.
d.
A student is domiciled in the school district when his or her parent or guardian resides within the school district on an all-year-round basis for one year or more, notwithstanding the existence of a domicile elsewhere.
e.
A student is domiciled in the school district if the Department of Children and Families is acting as the student’s guardian and has placed the student in the school district.
2.
When a student’s dwelling is located within two or more school districts, or bears a mailing address that does not reflect the dwelling’s physical location within a municipality, the school district of domicile for school attendance purposes shall be the municipality to which the majority of the dwelling’s property tax is paid, or to which the majority of the dwelling’s or unit’s property tax is paid.
a.
When property tax is paid in equal amounts to two or more municipalities, and there is no established assignment for students residing in the affected dwellings, the school district of domicile for school attendance purposes shall be determined through assessment of individual proofs as provided pursuant to N.J.A.C.
6A:22-3.4.
b.
This provision shall not preclude the attendance of currently enrolled students who were permitted to attend the school district prior to December 17, 2001.
c.
When a student’s parent or guardian elects to exercise such entitlement, nothing in N.J.A.C.
6A:22-3.1 shall exclude a student’s right to attend the school district of domicile although the student is qualified to attend a different school district pursuant to N.J.S.A.
18A:38-1.b or the temporary residency (less than one year) provision of N.J.S.A.
18A:38-1.d.
3.
Notwithstanding the provisions of N.J.S.A.
18A:38-1 or any other section of law to the contrary, a child who is domiciled within the school district and resides with a parent or guardian who is a member of the New Jersey National Guard or a member of the reserve component of the armed forces of the United States who is ordered into active military service in any of the armed forces of the United States in a time of war or national emergency, shall be permitted to remain enrolled in the school district in which the child is domiciled at the time of the parent or guardian being ordered into active military service, regardless of where the child resides during the period of active duty.
The school district shall not be responsible for providing transportation for the child if the child lives outside of the district.
Following the return of the child’s parent or guardian from active military service, the child’s eligibility to remain enrolled in the school district pursuant to N.J.S.A.
18A:38-3.1 shall cease at the end of the current school year unless the child is domiciled in the school district.

If the record of the appeal includes a calculation reflecting the 
tuition rate(s) for the year(s) at issue, the per diem tuition rate for the current year and the date on which the student’s ineligible attendance began, the Commissioner may order payment of tuition as part of his or her decision.
In doing so, the Commissioner shall consider whether the ineligible attendance was due to the school district’s error.
If the record does not include such a calculation and the Board of Education has filed a counterclaim for tuition, the counterclaim shall proceed to a hearing notwithstanding that the petition has been abandoned.
