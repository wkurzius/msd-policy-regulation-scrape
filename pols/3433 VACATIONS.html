3433 - VACATIONS
Section: Teaching Staff Members
Date Created: October 2009
Date Edited: October 2009
The Board of Education believes that the school district benefits when teaching staff members employed to work twelve months a year are given periodic relief from the responsibilities of their positions without loss of compensation.
The Board reserves the right to determine the conditions under which vacation time may be taken when not otherwise covered by the terms of a negotiated agreement or in an individual contract with the Board.
