Section: Community
Date Created: October 2009
Date Edited: July 2024
Principals have a need to receive and have access to juvenile justice proceedings involving juveniles who are registered students in the school building.
The Principal or designee shall have access to information relating to juvenile justice proceedings in accordance with N.J.S.A.
2A:4A-60.
The Principal or designee, on a confidential basis, may request from law enforcement agencies at the time of charge, adjudication, or disposition, information as to the identity of a juvenile student charged, the offense charged, the adjudication, and the disposition.
The Principal or designee may inform school staff members of this information if the Principal or designee deems it appropriate for maintaining order, safety, or discipline in the school or for planning programs relevant to the juvenile’s educational and social development.
This information will not become part of the juvenile student’s permanent school record and shall not be maintained except as authorized by regulation of the New Jersey Department of Education (NJDOE).
A law enforcement or prosecuting agency shall, at the time of a charge, adjudication, or disposition, send written notice to the Principal or designee of the school where the juvenile is enrolled, of the identity of the juvenile charged, the offense charged, the adjudication, and the disposition if:
1.
The offense occurred on school property or a school bus, occurred at a school-sponsored function, or was committed against an employee or official of the school;
2.
The juvenile was taken into custody as a result of information or evidence provided by school officials; or
3.
The offense, if committed by an adult, would constitute a crime, and the offense:
a.
Resulted in death or serious bodily injury or involved an attempt or conspiracy to cause death or serious bodily injury;
b.
Involved the unlawful use or possession of a firearm or other weapon;
c.
Involved the unlawful manufacture, distribution, or possession with intent to distribute a controlled dangerous substance or controlled substance analog;
d.
Was committed by a juvenile who acted with a purpose to intimidate an individual or group of individuals because of race, color, religion, sexual orientation, or ethnicity; or
e.
Would be a crime of the first, second, or third degree.
Information provided to the Principal or designee pursuant to N.J.S.A.
2A:4A-60.d.
shall be treated as confidential but may be made available to such members of the staff and faculty of the school as the Principal or designee deems appropriate for maintaining order, safety, or discipline in the school or for planning programs relevant to a juvenile’s educational and social development.
This information will not become part of the juvenile student’s permanent school record and shall not be maintained except as authorized by regulation of the NJDOE.
Law enforcement or the prosecuting agency may provide the Principal or designee with information identifying one or more juvenile students who are under investigation or have been taken into custody for the commission of any act that would constitute an offense if committed by an adult when the law enforcement or prosecuting agency determines that the information may be useful to the Principal or designee in maintaining order, safety, or discipline in the school or in planning programs relevant to the juvenile’s educational and social development.
Information provided in accordance with N.J.S.A.
2A:4A-60.e.
shall be treated as confidential, but the Principal or designee may inform school staff members of this information if the Principal or designee deems it appropriate for maintaining order, safety, or discipline in the school or for planning programs relevant to the juvenile’s educational and social development.
No information provided pursuant to N.J.S.A.
2A:4A-60 shall be maintained.
The Principal or designee who requests and/or receives information as specified in this Policy shall notify the Superintendent or designee within twenty-four hours of the request being made.
In accordance with N.J.S.A.
53:1-20.6, the Principal or designee shall notify the Superintendent or designee of any applicable fees associated with the request.
The school district shall comply with the NJDOE rules and regulations concerning the creation, maintenance, and disclosure of student records regarding Principal or designee notification of juvenile offender case disposition and this Policy.
