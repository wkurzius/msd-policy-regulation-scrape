The school Principal may request from law enforcement agencies at the time of charge, adjudication or disposition, information as to the identity of a juvenile pupil charged, the adjudication and the disposition.
The school Principal may inform school staff members of this information if the Principal deems it appropriate for maintaining order, safety or discipline in the school or for planning programs relevant to the juvenile’s educational and social development.

Law enforcement or the prosecuting agency may provide the school Principal with information identifying one or more juveniles who are under investigation or who have been taken into custody for the commission of any act that would constitute an offense if committed by an adult when the law enforcement or prosecuting agency determines that the information may be useful to the Principal in maintaining order, safety, or discipline in the school or in planning programs relevant to the juvenile’s educational and social development.
Information provided in accordance with the section above shall be treated as confidential, but the school Principal may inform school staff members of this information if the Principal deems it appropriate for maintaining order, safety or discipline in the school or for planning programs relevant to the juvenile’s educational and social development.
No information provided in accordance with this paragraph shall be maintained.
The Principal who requests and/or receives information as specified in this policy shall notify the Superintendent or designee within twenty-four hours.
