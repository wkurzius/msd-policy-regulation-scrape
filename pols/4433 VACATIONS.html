4433 - VACATIONS
Section: Support Staff
Date Created: October 2009
Date Edited: October 2009
The Board of Education believes that it is beneficial to the school district that persons employed to work twelve months a year be given periodic relief from the responsibilities of their position without loss of compensation.
The Board reserves the right to determine the conditions under which vacation time may be taken when not otherwise covered by the terms of a negotiated agreement or in an individual contract with the Board.
