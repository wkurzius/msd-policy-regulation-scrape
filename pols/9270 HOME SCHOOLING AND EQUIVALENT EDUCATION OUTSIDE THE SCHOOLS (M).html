9270 - HOME SCHOOLING AND EQUIVALENT EDUCATION OUTSIDE THE SCHOOLS (M)
Section: Community
Date Created: October 2009
Date Edited: April 2012
M
The Board of Education encourages the enrollment of all children of school age resident in the district in public schools or in approved private schools so that they may enjoy the benefits of a well-planned educational program and the socialization possible in a group environment.
Every parent, legal guardian or other person having custody and control of a child between the ages of six and sixteen years shall cause such child regularly to attend the public school or a day school in which there is given instruction equivalent to that provided in the public schools for children of similar grades and attainments or to receive equivalent instruction elsewhere than at school.
The Board recognizes its responsibility for assuring that every child of school age resident in the district is enrolled in a public or private school or is offered an equivalent thorough and efficient education elsewhere than at school.
The Board acknowledges that a parent, guardian, or other person having custody and control of a child has a constitutional right to choose the type and character of education they feel is best suited for their child(ren), be it secular or sectarian.
Home schooling is an option and when chosen this option will be carried out in the pupil’s home rather than the school.
In the event the Superintendent determines there is credible evidence the parent, legal guardian, or other person having custody and control of a school-aged child is not causing the child to receive equivalent instruction elsewhere than at school, the Superintendent may request a letter of intent from the parent, legal guardian, or other person confirming the child is receiving equivalent instruction elsewhere than at school.
The Superintendent may report to the appropriate municipal authorities children whom he/she has reason to believe are not receiving an education in accordance with N.J.S.A.

The New Jersey Department of Education encourages the parent, legal guardian, or other person having custody and control of a school-aged child to notify the Superintendent of the intent to educate the child elsewhere than at school to avoid questions with respect to compliance with the compulsory education laws.
The parent or legal guardian or other person having custody and control of a child between the ages of six and sixteen, who fails to comply with any of the compulsory education provisions of N.J.S.A.
18A:38 et seq.
relating to his/her duties, shall be deemed to be a disorderly person and shall be subject to a fine.
If a child seeks admission to this school district from a program of home schooling, the school district will evaluate the work of the child to determine his/her appropriate grade placement.
The Superintendent or designee will objectively evaluate the child’s skill and achievement levels, as it would with any transfer pupil, before making a determination as to the acceptability of credits and/or the appropriate grade level placement.
When children are home schooled and are not enrolled in a school, the school district is not required to
provide any of the entitlements or privileges of pupils enrolled in the school district unless an entitlement or privilege is specifically provided in Board Policy or required by Federal law, or State statute or administrative code.
The school district’s curriculum and other public record information will be provided to the parent, legal guardian, or other person having custody and control of a child upon request in accordance with the Open Public Records Act and Policy and Regulation 8310.
A child educated at home shall not receive a State endorsed high school diploma from the Board of Education.
