District Policy
6113 - E-RATE
Section: Finances
Date Created: April 2013
Date Edited: April 2013
The Telecommunications Act of 1996 provides for a Federal funded program called the Universal Service Fund (USF) or E-Rate that is designed to provide affordable access to telecommunications services for all eligible schools and libraries in the United States.
The program provides discounts on telecommunications services, Internet access and internal connections, and provides discounts of up to ninety percent to assist most schools and libraries in the United States to obtain affordable telecommunications and Internet access.
The purpose of this Policy is to provide guidance and direction so the Manville School District can participate in the E-Rate program and this Policy assigns E-Rate responsibilities to school staff members to ensure the school district is in compliance with Federal Communications Commission and E-Rate participation requirements.
Full access to telecommunications and information resources makes possible the rich teaching and learning that take place in schools and libraries.
For these institutions to provide the high level of service necessary for their pupils and patrons to participate fully in American society, the costs can be great.
Telecommunications and Internet access, the hardware needed for assembling local networks, and maintenance of systems and machines can stretch budgets that are already under stress.
Universal Service Administrative Company (USAC) is responsible for processing applications for support, confirming eligibility, and reimbursing telecommunications companies and Internet access providers for discounted services delivered to eligible schools and libraries.
USAC reviews applications, invoices, and other program information to ensure that applicants and service providers follow rules for the program set by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC).
USAC also conducts Schools and Libraries Program beneficiary audits to ensure program compliance.
Eligible participants include public and most non-profit Kindergarten through grade twelve schools as well as all public and many private libraries.
All program participants must carry out a competitive bidding process to select the most cost-effective companies to provide the goods and/or services requested.
Once eligible school districts complete the competitive bidding process, applicants submit to USAC all information required to demonstrate compliance with the rules required for receiving support.
After approving applications, USAC notifies applicants of a commitment to fund the acquisition of services.
When applicants start receiving services, USAC makes payments to the companies selected to provide those services.
Funding may be requested under five categories of service: Telecommunications, Telecommunications Services, Internet Access, Internal Connections, and Basic Maintenance of Internal Connections.
Discounts for support depend on the level of poverty and the urban/rural status of the population served and range from twenty percent to ninety percent of the costs of eligible services.
Eligible participants include public and most non-profit Kindergarten through grade twelve schools as well as all public and many private libraries.
Guidance on the eligibility requirements to participate in the E-Rate Program is available on the USAC website at www.usac.org.
This Policy provides the steps to be used by this school district to receive E-Rate discounts.
Technology Plan
A Technology Plan is a plan prepared by the school district that explains how telecommunications and information technology will be used to achieve educational goals, curriculum reforms, or library service improvements.
School districts applying for Priority 2 services (Internal Connections and Basic Maintenance) must prepare a technology plan.
In general, Technology Plans should not cover more than three years.
Technology Plans should be written (at least in draft form) before an FCC Form 470 is posted to the USAC website in order to support the requests for services featured on that form, cover all twelve months of the funding year, and be approved by a USAC-certified Technology Plan Approver (TPA) before an FCC Form 486 is filed and before services start.
Technology Plans must, at a minimum, contain: clear goals and a realistic strategy for using telecommunications and information technology to improve education or library services; a professional development strategy to ensure that members of the staff know how to use these new technologies to improve education or library services; a needs assessment of the telecommunication services, hardware, software, and other services that will be needed to improve education or library services; and an evaluation process that enables the school district to monitor progress toward the specified goals and make mid-course corrections in response to new developments and opportunities as they arise.
In order to be eligible for E-Rate funding, the school district must have its Technology Plan approved for E-Rate use by the New Jersey Department of Education.
The Technology Coordinator shall be responsible for developing the school district’s technology plans and submitting the plans for approval to the New Jersey Department of Education.
The school district Technology Plan will be developed by the Technology Coordinator and submitted for approval to the Manville School District Board of Education for approval prior to submittal in PDF format to the Somerset County Office for approval.
Upon County approval the schools 3 year technology plan and county approval letter will be submitted to the NJDOE.
Typically the submittal deadline is June 30th.
Competitive Bidding Process
A competitive bidding process is a formal process to identify and request the products and services a school district needs so potential service providers can review these requests and submit bids.
To open the process, the school district must post an FCC Form 470 to the USAC website and, if the school district chooses to or if required by the New Jersey Public School Contracts Law, N.J.S.A.
18A:18A-1 et seq., issue a Request for Proposals or prepare bid specifications.
The school district will determine eligible E-Rate funding products and services based on the needs as outlined in the school district’s approved New Jersey Department of Education Technology Plan or as identified by the Superintendent, in consultation with school district administrative and technology staff members.
The entity that will run the competitive bidding process (which may be the school district, a State procurement agency, or another entity that the district has authorized to negotiate on its behalf with a Letter of Agency (LOA) or similar document) must file the FCC Form 470 (Description of Services Requested and Certification) and must be prepared to receive and evaluate bids and negotiate with service providers.
The FCC Form 470 for the upcoming funding year is generally available online on the USAC website a year before the start of the funding year.
FCC Form 470 can be filed for a particular funding year as soon as it becomes available online.
The entity filing the FCC Form 470 must wait at least twenty-eight days after the date that the FCC Form 470 is posted and the date the RFP is issued, whichever is later, before closing the competitive bidding process.
Services provided under tariff or on a month-to-month basis require an FCC Form 470 to be posted each year.
If, however, a multi-year contract results from the competitive bidding process, it is not necessary to post a new FCC Form 470 until a new contract is required.
After the FCC Form 470 is posted to the USAC website, USAC will issue an FCC Form 470 Receipt Notification Letter (RNL).
This letter includes much of the information featured on the form, provides a means to correct certain errors, and discusses the next steps in the application process.
The Technology Coordinator and School Business Administrator will review the RNL to ensure the products and services included in the RNL are accurate and will notify USAC within fifteen days of the postmark date of the RNL if there are any required revisions.
If an unallowable correction on the Form 470 is identified, the district must post and certify a new Form 470 within the filing window.
A new Form 470 must be posted at least twenty-eight days prior to signing a contract or selecting a service provider.
The entity filing an FCC Form 470 can issue a Request for Proposals (RFP) in addition to the FCC Form 470.
For the purposes of this Policy, an RFP is a formal bidding document that describes the project and requested services in sufficient detail so that potential bidders understand the scope, location, and any other requirements.
The district’s formal bidding documents must indicate the district will accept bids on equal and/or equivalent goods or services.
The district is not required to issue an RFP unless the State or local procurement rules or regulations require the district to do so.
If the district issued or intends to issue an RFP, that information must be included on the FCC Form 470 along with information on how to obtain a copy of the RFP.
The entity filing the FCC Form 470 must ensure the competitive bidding process is open and fair.
All bidders must be treated the same and no bidder can have advance knowledge of the project information.
There shall be no secrets in the bidding process, such as information shared with one bidder but not with others.
All bidders shall know what is required of them.
Service providers and potential service providers cannot offer or provide gifts to applicants and no school district employee or official shall solicit or accept a gift of any value from a service provider or potential service provider.
These prohibitions are in effect during the entire funding year.
In addition, the value of free services (e.g., price reductions, promotional offers, “free” products) must generally be deducted from the pre-discount cost of funding requests.
The competitive bidding process and the FCC 470 RNL process shall be coordinated and supervised by the School Business Administrator.
Selecting Service Providers
After the close of the competitive bidding process, the school district shall evaluate the bids received and choose the bid that is the most cost-effective with the price of the E-Rate eligible products and services as the primary factor.
The district may consider as many factors in this evaluation as it wants, but the price of the E-Rate eligible products and services must be included as a factor and must be weighted more heavily than any other single factor.
The FCC Form 470 and the Request for Proposals (RFP), if issued, must both have been publicly available for a twenty-eight day period, whichever is later, before the district can close its competitive bidding process.
Any evaluation of bids shall be in accordance with the New Jersey Public School Contracts Law, N.J.S.A.
18A:18A-1 et seq.
and FCC Competitive Bidding Rules.
Preparing a Bid Evaluation Matrix helps evaluate bids and also provides documentation of the process followed to select a service provider.
The Bid Evaluation Matrix shall be completed by the School Business Administrator.
All copies of bids (successful and unsuccessful), evaluation criteria, vendor contact information, and the signed contract shall be retained in accordance with the document retention guidance outlined in this Policy.
The district can receive services:
1.
Under tariff or on a month-to-month basis - Services such as basic telephone service or Internet access may not require a contract.
The district must post an FCC Form 470 and open a competitive bidding process for these services each year.
2.
Under a contract - Tariffed or month-to-month services provided under a contract are considered to be contracted services.
Also, internal connections and basic maintenance products and services are generally provided under a contract.
If the district posts an FCC Form 470 and signs a multi-year contract resulting from that posting, the district does not have to post an FCC Form 470 or open a competitive bidding process again for the life of that contract.
If the district intends to receive services under contract, the contract must have been preceded by the filing of an FCC Form 470 (NOTE: If the district has an existing contract that was not signed as a result of posting an FCC Form 470, the district can post an FCC Form 470 for the next funding year and consider its existing contract as a bid response.
The district must evaluate any other bids received as well, as the district’s existing contract may not be the most cost-effective solution.).
The entity that filed the FCC Form 470 must also have followed the Schools and Libraries Program’s competitive bidding rules and all applicable State and local contract and procurement rules and regulations.
The Board shall approve all contracts for products or services if the products or services were bid in accordance with N.J.S.A.
18A:18A-1 et seq., where an RFP was used to obtain proposals, or any contract to be awarded in excess of $36,000.
The district may sign a contract, which may be for one or more years and may include the option of voluntary extensions.
If the district is eligible, it can purchase services from a State master contract; however, the district must file their own FCC Form 470 and use the State master contract pricing as a bid to consider in evaluating all potential bids.
If the district is eligible to purchase from a State master contract, but that contract will expire before or during the upcoming funding year, the district and the State of New Jersey should follow the guidance for State replacement contracts (See State Master Contracts section on USAC website at www.usac.org).
The evaluation of bids and the selection of service providers or recommending service providers to the Board of Education, if required, shall be the responsibility of the School Business Administrator.
Applying for Discounts
To apply for Schools and Libraries Program discounts, the district must file an FCC Form 471 to provide USAC with information about the services being requested and the eligible discount(s).
USAC will review the request, may ask for additional information, and will then issue a funding decision.
All contracts, if contracts are required, must be signed and dated before the FCC Form 471 is submitted to USAC.
The FCC Form 471 must be filed during a specific application window each year.
In general, the application filing window opens about six months before the start of the funding year and is open for about two and a half months.
All applications received or postmarked before the close of the filing window are considered as having arrived on the same day, and have priority over those submitted after the filing window has closed.
The specific opening and closing dates of the filing window are published in advance on the USAC website.
After the FCC Form 471 is certified online or on paper, USAC will issue an FCC Form 471 Receipt Acknowledgment Letter (RAL).
The RAL shall be reviewed by the School Business Administrator within twenty calendar days of the school district’s receipt of the RAL.
This letter includes much of the information featured on the form, provides a means to correct certain errors, and discusses the next steps in the application process.
The information the district must provide on the FCC Form 471 includes the following:
1.
Entity numbers (also called Billed Entity Numbers (BENs)) for all entities receiving service (recipients of service), together with specific information for each entity (Block 4 of the form).
2.
NCES and/or FSCS codes for entities receiving service (Block 4).
3.
Information on telephone and Internet access connections and speeds (Block 2).
For each funding request (a service or set of services specific to both a category of service and a service provider) the district must also provide:
Student counts to use for calculating discounts - the total number of pupils and the total number of pupils eligible for the National School Lunch Program (NSLP) as determined by the Annual State Aid Report  (ASSA).
The FCC also sanctions other mechanisms to determine a school's or district’s level of need, as long as those mechanisms are based on - or do not exceed - the same measure of poverty used by NSLP.
The School Business Administrator will verify the student data used to calculate discounts in accordance with the eligibility requirements of the National School Lunch Program and the New Jersey Department of Agriculture.
2.
Specific information on each service or set of services the district is requesting, including:
a.
Name and Service Provider Identification Number (SPIN) of the service provider;
b.
Cost of the service;
c.
Contract number and other contract details (if there is a contract);
d.
Start and end dates of service;
e.
Worksheet(s) identifying the entity or set of entities receiving each service; and
f.
A detailed description of products and services, referred to as an Item 21 attachment.
These products and services shall be reviewed by the Technology Coordinator to ensure they are eligible for E-Rate funding according to the  current Eligible Service List as published on the USAC website.
The district’s certified FCC Form 471 and Item 21 attachment(s) are due on or before the close of the application filing window.
The school district is only able to receive support for internal connections in two of every five funding years.
This applies to individual recipients (individual schools, libraries, or non-instructional facilities).
For each eligible entity, the five-year period begins in any year in which that entity receives support for internal connections.
Entities can use two years within any five-year period, looking back and looking forward from that year.
FY 2007 was the first year  that entities were ineligible for internal connections funding based on this rule (for entities that received funding for both FY 2005 and FY 2006 internal connections requests).
USAC provides a Two-in-Five Tool that provides information on the school district’s eligibility for funding of internal connections requests for multiple funding years.
This rule does not apply to telecommunications and Internet access services or to basic maintenance of internal connections services categorized as Priority 2.
Basic maintenance services are eligible for support each year if they are necessary to the operation of the internal connections network.
The school district will be considered to have used a year if it has been specified in the FCC Form 471 Block 4 worksheet cited on one or more approved internal connections funding requests in that year.
The Technology Coordinator shall be responsible for applying for discounts from the School and Libraries Program.
Application Review
After the district files an FCC Form 471 and the associated Item 21 attachment(s) within the filing window, Program Integrity Assurance (PIA) reviewers at USAC will check the information on the form for completeness and accuracy and may have additional questions for the district to answer.
All applications go through an initial review and a final review, which may involve questions from PIA reviewers on one or more of the following topics:
1.
Eligibility of the entities receiving service (this review step generally occurs for entities that have not appeared on a previous application);
2.
Eligibility of the services requested;
3.
Discount calculations;
4.
Contracts;
5.
The competitive bidding process; and/or
6.
Any discrepancies between the information on the funding request and the associated Item 21 attachment.
The district must indicate the preferred mode of contact on FCC Form 471 Item 6c (telephone), 6d (fax), or 6e (email).
Because PIA reviewers send written questions by fax or email, they will call the district and ask for a fax number or email address if the district indicated telephone as the preferred mode of contact.
The district will have fifteen days to respond to PIA questions.
The district can ask for more time, if needed, but a request for additional time will add more time to the review process.
Some applications undergo additional review - Selective Review is one example - where PIA reviewers may request more detailed responses that can include:
1.
Documentation of the competitive bidding and service provider (vendor) selection processes;
2.
Documentation of the district’s ability to pay the non-discount share (the portion of the cost of eligible products and services not reimbursed by USAC); and/or
3.
Proof the district has obtained necessary resources (i.e., hardware, software, staff training, electrical capacity, retrofitting) that are not eligible for Schools and Libraries Program discounts, but that must be in place to make effective use of the discounted services.
As part of the review process, PIA reviewers may be required to change the category of service on a Funding Request Number (FRN).
If PIA reviewers discover there are ineligible services in a funding request, the district will be able to remove them or move them to a separate request to avoid denial under the thirty percent rule.
After the PIA review process has been completed, USAC issues a Funding Commitment Decision Letter (FCDL) containing USAC’s decisions on the district’s funding requests.
The district should review this letter carefully, as it contains important information both for planning the start of the receipt of services and for completing the additional steps in the application process.
If the district disagrees with one or more of the decisions in the FCDL, the district can appeal to USAC or to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC).
The Technology Coordinator shall be responsible for preparing and providing the requested documentation for the application review(s).
Starting Services
After the district receives the Funding Commitment Decision Letter (FCDL) and the delivery of services has started, the service provider shall be responsible for: filing a FCC Form 486 to inform USAC that services for which the district has been approved for discounts have started and invoicing can begin; assuring the district’s Technology Plan, if required, has been approved by a USAC-certified Technology Plan Approver and the district is in compliance with the Children's Internet Protection Act (CIPA), 47 CFR 54.520, or CIPA does not apply because the district’s application is only for Telecommunications Services and/or Interconnected Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) services.
CIPA requirements include an internet safety policy, a technology protection measure, a public notice hearing or meeting, the monitoring of online activities of minors, and providing education to minors on appropriate online behavior.
The School Business Administrator  shall be responsible for reviewing the originating purchase order and/or contract to ensure the products and services on the purchase order or contract have been received in the district, and the invoice from the provider is consistent with the purchase order/contract and products and services received.
In advance of the start of services, the district and its service provider(s) should have a conversation about the details of the services the district will be receiving.
The district should also review the contract, if there is a contract.
In addition, the district should determine whether the district or its service provider will invoice USAC for the discounted amount of the cost of the services.
Under certain circumstances, advanced installation of some Priority 1 components can occur before July 1 of the funding year.
The district can file an FCC Form 486 early (before services have started) if the district:
1.
Received its FCDL; and
2.
Services will start in the month of July; and
3.
The district can truthfully make all of the certifications in Block 4, which include compliance with the technology plan and CIPA requirements; and
4.
The district is filing the form on or before July 31.
NOTE: Early filing using Item 6a on the FCC Form 486 is an option if and only if services will start within the month of July of the relevant funding year, all relevant certifications in Block 4 can be accurately made, and the FCC Form 486 is postmarked on or before July 31 of the Funding Year.
The district must be in compliance with the Schools and Libraries Program's technology plan requirements and the requirements of CIPA before services start.
USAC cannot pay discounts on services received during a period of time when the district was not in compliance.
USAC may review the district’s compliance with these requirements either before or after the district’s FCC Form 486 is processed.
The FCC Form 486 must be certified no later than one hundred twenty days after the service start date or one hundred twenty days after the date of the FCDL, whichever is later.
Filing late can result in a reduction in funding; the later the filing date, the greater the reduction.
After USAC completes the processing of the district’s FCC Form 486, USAC will issue an FCC Form 486 Notification Letter.
This letter features the information the district provided on the form and outlines the next steps in the application process.
If USAC was required to adjust the service start date for a funding request due to a compliance issue, the service start date in the letter will be marked with an asterisk and followed by an explanation of the reason for the adjustment.
To be eligible for program support, eligible services must be received during a specific period of time related to the particular funding year for which discounts are requested.
Recurring services must be delivered during the relevant funding year (July 1 through June 30).
In general, non-recurring services must be delivered and installed between July 1 of the relevant funding year and  September 30, following the June 30 close of that funding year (i.e., fifteen months after the beginning of the funding year).
However, certain recipients have received or may receive extensions of the deadline for delivery and installation of non-recurring services.
Such extensions can occur for various reasons, including:
1.
A Funding Commitment Decision Letter     
(FCDL) was issued by USAC on or after March 1 of the funding year for which support was authorized.
2.
Operational SPIN changes or service substitutions were approved by USAC on or after March 1 of the funding year.
3.
The school district or service provider requested an extension because the service provider was unable to complete delivery and installation for reasons beyond the service provider's control.
4.
The school district or service provider requested an extension because the service provider has been unwilling to complete delivery and installation after USAC withheld payment for those services on a properly-submitted invoice for more than sixty days after submission of the invoice.
USAC will automatically extend the service delivery deadline in situations where criteria (1) or (2) listed above are met.
Recipients of non-recurring services that wish to satisfy criterion (3) must submit documentation to USAC on or before September 30 following the close of the funding year.
A recipient of service that meets criterion (4) must certify to USAC on or before September 30 following the close of the funding year that its service provider was unwilling to deliver or install non-recurring services before the expiration of the deadline after USAC had withheld payment for those services on a properly submitted invoice for more than sixty days after the submission of the invoice.
The district’s third party e rate vendor shall be responsible to coordinate the filing of the FCC Form 486.
After USAC has processed the district’s FCC Form 486, the district or its service provider can begin the process of invoicing USAC for the discount share of the approved eligible services.
The Business Administrator , in consultation with the school business office staff member responsible for authorizing the payment of invoices, shall be responsible for reviewing the originating purchase order and/or contract, the products or services on the purchase order or contract have been received by district, and the invoice from the service provider is consistent with the purchase order or contract.
The third party e rate vendor shall only submit reimbursement requests to USAC for eligible products and services once the district’s non-discounted portion is paid.
There are two methods that can be used to invoice USAC.
Once USAC has processed an invoice for a funding request, that method of invoicing must be used for that particular funding request for the remainder of the invoicing process.
1.
Invoice Method #1 
Applicants file FCC Form 472, Billed Entity Applicant Reimbursement (BEAR) Form if the district paid the service provider in full for the services and want to be reimbursed for the discount amount.
The service provider must approve the form before it is submitted to USAC.
USAC will review the invoice and process a payment to the service provider if payment is approved.
The service provider then passes the reimbursement on to the applicant.
2.
Invoice Method #2 
Service providers file FCC Form 474, Service Provider Invoice (SPI) Form if they have provided discounted bills to their customer and want to be reimbursed for the discount amount.
Under both invoice methods, USAC will review the invoice and process a payment to the service provider if payment is approved.
Applicants are required to pay the non-discount portion of the cost of the services.
The district can file a BEAR Form after all of the following have occurred:
1.
The district received a Funding Commitment Decision Letter (FCDL); and 
2.
The district has filed, and USAC has processed, an FCC Form 486; and
3.
The district’s service provider has filed an FCC Form 473, Service Provider Annual Certification (SPAC) Form (disbursements cannot be made until the SPAC has been filed with USAC); and
4.
The district paid for the service in full; and
5.
In general, the services must have been delivered (an exception can be made for progress payments specified in a contract).
The district must file, and the service provider must approve, BEAR Forms no later than one hundred twenty days after the last day to receive service or one hundred twenty days after the FCC Form 486 Notification Letter date, whichever is later.
If the deadline is missed the district can request an invoice deadline extension.
After processing the district’s BEAR Form, USAC will issue a BEAR Notification Letter with information about the processing of the district’s form.
If the district needs more information about a reduction or denial of payment, the district should refer to the invoice error code(s) featured on the letter.
After the end of each calendar quarter, USAC issues a Quarterly Disbursement Report that details all invoicing activity, BEAR Forms, and SPI Forms processed during that quarter for all funding years.
This report allows the district to track all of the invoicing activity related to the district’s Billed Entity Number (BEN).
The district can initiate an invoice check if it would like to be notified each time the district’s service provider submits a SPI Form.
The Technology Coordinator shall be responsible to ensure that all eligible E-Rate goods and services have been received, the service provider invoices are correct and the district’s non-discounted portion of the invoice has been paid before submitting invoices to USAC.
The School Business Administrator shall review the eligible reimbursements that are made to any service provider to ensure the amounts being billed to USAC and the school district equal 100% of the invoiced amount.
The School Business Administrator will notify USAC and the provider in the event there are any problems with this reconciliation.
Annual Policy Review
The School Business Administrator shall be responsible to ensure this Policy is reviewed annually and make recommendation for any revisions to this Policy as needed.
Document Retention
All documents related to the E-rate Program, including but not limited to, the application process, the competitive bidding/vender selection process, and the invoicing process shall be retained for at least five years after the last date of service delivered for a particular funding year or in accordance with the New Jersey Division of Archives and Records Management Schedules of Record Retention, whichever is longer.
