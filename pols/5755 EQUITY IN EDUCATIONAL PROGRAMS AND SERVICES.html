Equity In Student Access
It is the policy of the Board of Education to ensure equal and bias-free access to all school facilities, courses, programs, activities, and services, regardless of race, color, creed, religion, national origin, ancestry, age, marital status, affectational or sexual orientation, gender, gender identity or expression, socioeconomic status, or disability.
The school district administration will ensure: that all students will have equal and barrier-free access to all school and classroom facilities, that minority and female students are not under-represented in gifted and talented or accelerated/advanced courses and that minority and male students are not over-represented in detentions, suspensions, expulsions, dropouts, or special needs classifications.
Support services will be available to all students and that all limited English-proficient students and students with disabilities will have equal and bias-free access to all school programs and activities.
The school district will ensure equal and bias-free access for all students to computers, computer classes, vocational education classes, and technologically-advanced instructional assistance, regardless of race, color, creed, religion, national origin, ancestry, age, marital status, affectational or sexual orientation, gender, gender identity or expression, socioeconomic status, or disability.
The Board of Education will refrain from locating new facilities in areas that will contribute to imbalanced, isolated, or racially identifiable school enrollments.
The school district administration will assign students to ensure that the racial/national origin composition of each school’s enrollment reflects the composition of the districtwide enrollment and so that school and classroom enrollments are not identifiable on the basis of race, color, creed, religion, national origin, ancestry, age, marital status, affectational or sexual orientation, gender, gender identity or expression, socioeconomic status, or disability.
Students will not be separated or isolated by race, color, creed, religion, national origin, ancestry, age, marital status, affectational or sexual orientation, gender, gender identity or expression, socioeconomic status, or disability within schools, courses, classes, programs, or extracurricular activities.
Bias-free multiple measures for determining the special needs of language-minority students and students with disabilities will be utilized.
Pregnant students will be permitted to remain in the regular school program and activities and if not permitted to attend school by her doctor, the student will be provided equivalent instruction.
Equity in Guidance Programs and Support Services
The school district will ensure the guidance program and support services provides access to adequate and appropriate counseling services for all students, including, but not limited to, minority students, limited English-proficient students, non-college bound students, and students with disabilities.
A full range of possible career, professional, and/or vocational choices will be presented to all students.
Equity in Physical Education Training
All school district physical education programs will be co-educational with any exceptions to be in accordance with Federal and State laws and regulations.
Equity in Athletic Programs
