8335 - FAMILY EDUCATIONAL RIGHTS AND PRIVACY ACT
Section: Operations
Date Created: October 2009
Date Edited: October 2009
The Board of Education policies and regulations will be in compliance with the requirements of the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA).
FERPA affords parents and adult pupils certain rights with respect to the pupil’s education records.
FERPA requires the district to provide parents and adult pupils the right to inspect and review the pupil’s education records within forty-five days of the day the school district receives a request for access, to request an amendment(s) of the pupil’s education records the parent or adult pupil believes are inaccurate, and to consent to disclosures of personally identifiable information contained in the pupil's education records, except to the extent that FERPA authorizes disclosure without consent.
FERPA permits disclosure of pupil records without consent if the disclosure is to school officials with legitimate educational interests.
FERPA permits the school district to disclose education records without a parent’s or adult pupil’s consent to officials of another school district in which a pupil seeks or intends to enroll.
FERPA requires a school district to make a reasonable attempt to notify the parent or adult pupil of the records re&#xad;quest unless it states in its annual notification that it intends to forward records on request.
The parent or adult pupil has the right to file a complaint with the U.S.
Department of Education concerning alleged failures by the district to comply with the requirements of FERPA.
The name and address of the Office that administers FERPA is:
