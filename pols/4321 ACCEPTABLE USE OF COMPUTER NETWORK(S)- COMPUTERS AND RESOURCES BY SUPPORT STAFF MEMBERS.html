COMPUTERS AND RESOURCES BY SUPPORT STAFF MEMBERS
Section: Support Staff
Date Created: October 2009
Date Edited: October 2009
The Manville Board of Education recognizes that as telecommunications and other new technologies shift the manner in which information is accessed, communicated, and transferred, such changes will require a set of standards to which all users must adhere.
The Board adopts the following standards of conduct for the use of computer/network(s) and declares unethical, unacceptable, inappropriate or illegal behavior as just cause for taking disciplinary action, limiting or revoking network access privileges, instituting legal action or taking any other appropriate action as deemed necessary.
The Board provides access to technology including but not limited to computer networks/computers, the Internet, and electronic mail.
The system is not intended to create an "open forum" or "limited open forum" regarding the expression of ideas/opinions by staff members.
The system is not to be used for the expression of opinions or religious, social, or political issues, or the solicitation, fundraising or advertisement for non- school related organizations.
The Board retains the right to restrict or terminate staff members' access to the computer networks/computers at any time, for any reason.
The Board retains the right to have the Superintendent or his/her designee monitor network activity, in any form necessary, to maintain the integrity of the network(s) and ensure its proper use.
