If upon completing an examination(s) it is determined a candidate for employment who received a conditional offer of employment is unable to perform with reasonable accommodation job-related functions pursuant to the provisions of the ADA, the conditional offer of employment will be rescinded either by the Superintendent of Schools, if the Board has not yet approved the appointment, or by the Board, if the Board had approved the appointment at a Board meeting.
The physical examination shall include, but is not limited to, a health history to include past serious illnesses and injuries; current health problems; allergies; and a record of immunizations.
The physical examination shall also include a health screening to include, but not limited to:  height and weight; blood pressure; pulse and respiratory rate; vision screening; and hearing screening.
Pursuant to N.J.S.A.

However, the candidate shall bear the cost if the examination is performed by a physician or institution designated by the candidate with approval of the Board.
In the event the Board approves the physician or institution designated by the candidate to complete an examination required by this Policy, the candidate will be provided with the detailed requirements of the examination.
School employee physicals, examinations, and/or annual medical updates do not require screening or disclosure of HIV status.
