7513 - RECREATIONAL USE OF PLAYGROUNDS
Section: Property
Date Created: October 2009
Date Edited: October 2019
The Board of Education requires that the playground of the school affords residents with a recreational area when school is not in session.
In session is defined as when students are present which includes before and after care, athletics, clubs, etc.
The Board reserves the right to determine, in the interest of the safety of district residents and the integrity of the school facility, the uses to which the playground may be put and the hours when it may be used.
The Board will publish rules of conduct, which shall govern all persons who use the facilities of this district.
Pupils and employees of this district who violate those rules will be subject to discipline.
The Board directs that any other person who violates a rule of this Board be requested to leave the school premises.
Because of its potential for hazard, no object that is powered by fuel or battery shall be brought onto the school grounds for any purpose that is primarily recreational without the express permission of the Principal.
Such objects include, but are not limited to, mini-bikes, mopeds, motorized model airplanes, and rockets.
