M
In accordance with the provisions of N.J.S.A.
18A:38-25, every parent or other person having control and custody of a child between the ages of six and sixteen shall cause the child to regularly attend school.
The Board of Education requires students enrolled in the school district attend school regularly in accordance with the laws of the State.
For the purpose of this Policy and Regulation 5200, “parent” means the natural parent(s), adoptive parent(s), legal guardian(s), resource family parent(s), or surrogate parent(s) of a student.
When parents are separated or divorced, “parent” means the person or agency who has legal custody of the student, as well as the natural or adoptive parent(s) of the student, provided parental rights have not been terminated by a court of appropriate jurisdiction.
Notwithstanding the requirement of reporting student absences in the school register for State and Federal reporting purposes, “excused” and “unexcused” student absences, for the purpose of expectations and consequences regarding truancy, student conduct, promotion, retention, and the award of course credit is a Board decision outlined in N.J.A.C.
6A:16-7.6 and Policy and Regulation 5200.
In accordance with the provisions of N.J.A.C.
6A:16-7.6 and for the purposes of Policy and Regulation 5200, a student’s absence from school will either be excused or unexcused.
Unexcused absences will count toward truancy.
A parent or adult student shall provide advance notice to the school prior to the student being absent from school.
In accordance with N.J.S.A.
18A:36-25.6, if a student is determined to be absent from school without valid excuse, and if the reason for the student’s absence is unknown to school personnel, the Principal or designee shall immediately attempt to contact the student’s parent to notify the parent of the absence and determine the reason for the absence.
Students that are absent from school for any reason are responsible for the completion of assignments missed because of their absence.
In accordance with N.J.S.A.
18A:36-14, a student who is absent from school for observing a religious holiday shall not be deprived of any award, eligibility, or opportunity to compete for any award, or deprived of the right to take an alternate test or examination that was missed because of the absence provided there is a written excuse of such absence signed by the parent.
Prolonged or repeated absences, excused or unexcused, from school or from class, deprive students of the educational and classroom experiences deemed essential to learning and may result in retention at grade level or loss of credit or removal from a course that would count toward the high school diploma in accordance with policies of this Board.
Students shall be subjected to the school district’s response for unexcused absences that count toward truancy during the school year as outlined in N.J.A.C.
6A:16-7.6(a)4.
and Regulation 5200.
Unexcused absences from school or from classes within the school day may subject a student to consequences that may include the denial of a student’s participation in co-curricular activities and/or athletic competition.
Repeated absences from school interfere with efforts of the Board and its staff in the maintenance of good order and the continuity of classroom instruction and such absences may result in the removal of the student from a class or course of study.
The Superintendent shall calculate and monitor the average daily attendance rate for the district and for each school in the district.
Whenever the average daily attendance rate does not meet the New Jersey Department of Education requirements the Superintendent or designee shall develop a district improvement plan to improve student attendance pursuant to N.J.A.C.
