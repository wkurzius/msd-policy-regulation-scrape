3218 - USE, POSSESSION, OR DISTRIBUTION OF SUBSTANCES (M)
Section: Teaching Staff Members
Date Created: October 2009
Date Edited: October 2019
M
The Board of Education recognizes a teaching staff member who reports to work under the influence of a substance poses a significant threat to their health, safety, and welfare and the health, safety, and welfare of others, including students and other staff members.
The Board strongly advises any teaching staff member that has a dependency on a substance as defined in this Policy to seek appropriate treatment.
The Board has an obligation and the right to maintain a safe and healthy work environment and adopts this Policy as an important component toward maintaining a safe environment in the school district.
For the purpose of this Policy, “substance” or “substances” as defined in N.J.S.A.
18A:40A-9 and N.J.A.C.
6A:16-4.1(a) means alcoholic beverages; any controlled dangerous substances, including anabolic steroids as defined in N.J.S.A.
24:21-2 and N.J.S.A.
2C:35-2;  any chemical or chemical compound which releases vapors or fumes causing a condition of intoxication, inebriation, excitement, stupefaction, or dulling of the brain or nervous system, including, but not limited to, glue containing a solvent having the property of releasing toxic vapors or fumes as defined in N.J.S.A.
2C:35-10.4; and over-the-counter and prescription medications that are improperly used to cause intoxication, inebriation, excitement, stupefaction, or dulling of the brain or nervous system.
A teaching staff member shall be required to submit to an immediate medical examination to include a substance test if the Principal or designee has reasonable suspicion to believe a teaching staff member is under the influence of a substance during work hours or at a school-sponsored function where the teaching staff member has been assigned job responsibilities.
Refusal by a teaching staff member to consent to the medical examination including a substance test will be deemed a positive test result for substances.
In the event the results of the medical examination and substance test are not provided to the Superintendent, within twenty-four hours or as soon as the test results are available, it will be deemed a positive test result for substances and the teaching staff member shall be subject to appropriate discipline.
Any required medical examination and testing shall be paid for by the Board.
In the event the Board physician determines the teaching staff member was under the influence of a substance, the determination shall be reported to the Superintendent and the teaching staff member will be subject to appropriate discipline.
Appropriate discipline may include, but not be limited to, withholding an increment, terminating a non-tenured teaching staff member, and/or filing tenure charges for a tenured teaching staff member in accordance with law.
The teaching staff member will be afforded the opportunity to have positive test results confirmed using acceptable confirmation test practices.
This confirmation test shall be paid for by the teaching staff member.
In the event a teaching staff member’s medical examination and substance test results are negative for a substance or if the Board physician determines the teaching staff member was not under the influence of a substance, the results or determination shall be reported to the Superintendent and the teaching staff member shall be returned to their position unless the Superintendent has a reason the teaching staff member should not be returned to their position.
In accordance with the requirements of N.J.A.C.
6A:16-6.3(a), any staff member who, in the course of their employment, has reason to believe a staff member has unlawfully possessed or in any way been involved in the distribution of a controlled dangerous substance, including anabolic steroids, or drug paraphernalia, shall report the matter as soon as possible to the Principal, or in the absence of the Principal, the Principal’s designee responsible at the time of the alleged violation.
Either the Principal or designee shall notify the Superintendent who shall notify, as soon as possible, the County Prosecutor or other law enforcement official designated by the County Prosecutor to receive such information.
The Superintendent or designee shall provide to the County Prosecutor or designee all known information concerning the matter, including the identity of the staff member involved.
In accordance with the provisions of N.J.A.C.
6A:16-6.3(a)3, the Superintendent or designee shall not disclose the identity of a staff member who has voluntarily sought and participated in an appropriate treatment or counseling program for an alcohol or drug abuse problem, provided the staff member is not reasonably believed to be involved or implicated in drug-distribution activities.
An admission by a staff member in response to questioning initiated by the Principal or designee or following the discovery by the Principal or designee of a controlled dangerous substance, including anabolic steroids, or drug paraphernalia, shall not constitute a voluntary, self-initiated request for counseling and treatment.
A staff member who unlawfully possessed or in any way has been involved in the distribution of a controlled dangerous substance, including anabolic steroids or drug paraphernalia, pursuant to N.J.A.C.
6A:16-6.3, shall be subject to appropriate discipline which may include, but not be limited to, termination of a non-tenured teaching staff member or the filing of tenure charges for a tenured teaching staff member in accordance with law.
A teaching staff member who has been determined by the Board physician to be under the influence of a substance during work hours or at a school-sponsored function where the teaching staff member has been assigned job responsibilities may be offered a Last Chance Agreement upon the recommendation of the Superintendent and approval by the Board.
A written Last Chance Agreement must be approved by the Board.
