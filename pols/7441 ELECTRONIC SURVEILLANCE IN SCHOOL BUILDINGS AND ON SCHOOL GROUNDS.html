Section: Property
Date Created: October 2009
Date Edited: February 2019
M
The Board of Education authorizes the use of electronic surveillance systems in school buildings and on school grounds to enhance the safety and security for school district staff, students, community members, and other building occupants and to protect the school district’s buildings and grounds.
The content produced by the surveillance system under certain circumstances may be considered a student record and if so it will be subject to the Board of Education policy and regulation regarding confidential student records.
If the content of the surveillance system becomes the subject of a disciplinary proceeding, it shall be treated like other evidence in the proceeding.
In accordance with the provisions of N.J.S.A.
18A:41-9, if at least one school building of the school district is equipped with video surveillance equipment that is capable of streaming live video wirelessly to a remote location, the Board of Education shall enter into a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with local law enforcement authorities providing the authorities with the capacity to activate the equipment and view live streaming video.
The MOU shall include the provisions of N.J.S.A.
18A:41-9 and any additional information required by law enforcement officials.
In the event the parties to the MOU are unable to reach an agreement regarding any provision required to be included in the MOU as per N.J.S.A.
18A:41-9a, the County Prosecutor shall make the final determination regarding that provision.
Nothing in N.J.S.A.
18A:41-9 shall be construed as to require the installation of video surveillance equipment capable of streaming live video wirelessly to a remote site from a school building that does not have the ability to have live streaming video.
The Board of Education shall post signage in a prominent, public place in buildings and on school grounds where electronic surveillance equipment may be used.
In addition to posting, the district shall notify school staff members, parent(s), and students that electronic surveillance may be used in school buildings and on school grounds through publication in student and staff handbooks, school calendars, notice sent home with students, or any other effective means to publish the district’s use of electronic surveillance equipment in school buildings and on school grounds.
