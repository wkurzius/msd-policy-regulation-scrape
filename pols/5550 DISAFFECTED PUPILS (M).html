Section: Students
Date Created: October 2009
Date Edited: October 2009
M
The Board of Education believes that the educational needs of all pupils should be served.
The Board will make every reasonable effort to identify and serve disaffected pupils whose learning is impeded by environmental circumstances, the pupil's attitude, or an inappropriate instructional program.
For the purposes of this policy, "disaffected pupil" means the pupil who has instructional needs that are not being met by the regular instructional program and who is performing well below his/her social or academic capacity.
Disaffected pupils may include pupils unable to function properly within a traditional school program; pupils of average or above average intelligence and ability who achieve below their potential; pupils unable to establish occupational or future goals; pupils with a pattern of behavior problems, including problems with attendance and tardiness; pupils who lack motivation, direction, and decision making ability; pupils who possess a poor self-image; pupils suffering stressful family settings; pupils hostile toward adults and authority figures; pupils in difficulty with community and law enforcement agencies; and pupils lacking interest in school and avoiding involvement in school activities.
Teaching staff members shall be alert to pupils experiencing difficulty in their classes.
Any such pupil who does not appear to be disabled may be referred to the Intervention Referral Team (IRT).
A disaffected pupil who may have disabilities shall be referred to the Child Study Team for evaluation in accordance with Policy No.
