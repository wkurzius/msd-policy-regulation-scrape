3216 - DRESS AND GROOMING
Section: Teaching Staff Members
Date Created: October 2009
Date Edited: November 2010
The Board of Education believes that the appearance and dress of teaching staff members is an important component of the educational program of this school district.
The attitude of teaching staff members about their professional responsibilities and the importance of education in the lives of their pupils are reflected in their dress and appearance.
Accordingly, in order to create an atmosphere of respect for teachers and an environment conducive to discipline and learning, the Board establishes the following rules for the dress of teaching staff members in the performance of their professional duties:
The clothing and appearance of all teaching staff members shall be clean and neat; 
No clothing may be worn that constitutes a danger to health or safety to the wearer or to others, and no clothing may be worn that interferes with the instructional program; 
Appropriate dress footwear shall be worn by all staff.
A teaching staff member may request a waiver of this dress code for the performance of particular duties; such waivers may be granted by the principal; 
The building principal or the teaching staff member's supervisor, as appropriate shall determine whether a violation of this dress code has occurred and shall discuss the violation with the teaching staff member concerned.
Where a single violation so warrants or violations recur, the principal or supervisor may enter a reprimand in the teaching staff member's file and may recommend more stringent disciplinary measures.
The Building Principal shall have full discretion in temporarily suspending this dress code during after-school activities and/or special theme days â€“ i.e., School Spirit Day.
