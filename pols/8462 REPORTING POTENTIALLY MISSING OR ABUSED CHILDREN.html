If the child is in immediate danger a call shall be placed to 911 as well as to the SCR.
The school district shall prominently display information about the Department of Children and Families’ State Central Registry, a toll-free hotline for reporting child abuse, in each school of the district.
The information shall give instructions to call 911 for emergencies and shall include directions for accessing the Department of Children and Families’ website or social media platforms for more information on reporting abuse, neglect, and exploitation.
The information shall be in a format and language that is clear, simple, and understandable.
The information shall be on a poster and displayed at each school in at least one high-traffic, highly and clearly visible public area that is readily accessible to and widely used by students, pursuant to N.J.S.A.

The person having reason to believe that a child may be missing or may have been abused or neglected may inform the Principal or other designated school official(s) prior to notifying designated child welfare authorities if the action will not delay immediate notification.
The person notifying designated child welfare authorities shall inform the Principal or other designated school official(s) of the notification, if such had not occurred prior to the notification.
Notice to the Principal or other designated school official(s) need not be given when the person believes that such notice would likely endanger the reporter or student involved or when the person believes that such disclosure would likely result in retaliation against the student or in discrimination against the reporter with respect to his or her employment.
The Principal or other designated school official(s) upon being notified by a person having reason to believe that a child may be missing or may have been abused or neglected, must notify appropriate law enforcement authorities.
Notification to appropriate law enforcement authorities shall be made for all reports by employees, volunteers, or interns working in the school district.
Confirmation by another person is not required for a school district employee, volunteer, or intern to report the suspected missing, abused, or neglected child situation.
School district officials will cooperate with designated child welfare and law enforcement authorities in all investigations of potentially missing, abused, or neglected children in accordance with the provisions of N.J.A.C.
