A school district administrator shall be prohibited from exercising direct or indirect authority, supervision, or control over a relative of the administrator.
Where it is not feasible to eliminate such a direct or indirect supervisory relationship, appropriate screens and/or alternative supervision and reporting mechanisms must be put in place.
A school district administrator or Board member who has a relative who is a member of the bargaining unit shall be prohibited from discussing or voting on the proposed collective bargaining agreement with that unit or from participating in any way in negotiations, including, but not limited to, being a member of the negotiating team; nor should that school district administrator be present with the Board in closed session when negotiation strategies are being discussed; provided however, that the administrator may serve as a technical resource to the negotiating team and may provide technical information necessary to the collective bargaining process when no one else in the district can provide such information.
A school district administrator or Board member who has an immediate family member who is a member of the same Statewide union in another school district shall be prohibited from participating in any way in negotiations, including but not limited to, being a member of the negotiating team or being present with the Board of Education in closed sessions when negotiation strategies are being discussed, prior to the Board of Education attaining a Tentative Memorandum of Agreement with the bargaining unit that includes a salary guide and total compensation package.
Once the Tentative Memorandum of Agreement is established, a school district administrator with an immediate family member who is a member of the same State-wide union in another school district may fully participate in the process, absent other conflicts.
Notwithstanding these provisions, a district administrator who has an immediate family member who is a member of the same Statewide union in another district may serve as a technical resource to the negotiating team and may provide technical information necessary to the collective bargaining process when no one else in the district can provide the information.
