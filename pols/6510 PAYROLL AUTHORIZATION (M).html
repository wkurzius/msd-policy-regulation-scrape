The most substantial allocation of public funds for the operation of the school district is that made to the employees of the Board of Education for their services.
Compensation will be tendered only to persons duly employed by this Board and only for services rendered.
Each Board resolution to employ or reemploy a person will include the person’s name, position, and tenure status; the salary or rate of pay the person is to receive, the method of payment, the wage guide from which wages are derived, and the budget category to which the wages are to be charged; the period of time for which employment is authorized; and the school, grade, class or special assignment, as appropriate.
No person may be assigned duties as a substitute employee whose employment has not been approved by the Board.
The list to be approved by the Board will include the names of recommended substitutes, the duties to which each may be assigned, and the rate of pay.
Substitute authorization will ordinarily be valid for one school year.
The minutes of Board meetings will record personnel actions of the Board, to include, but not be limited to, the appointment, promotion, resignation, retirement, death, discharge, compensation, or leave of absence for each employee.
The minutes will also include effective dates for personnel action.
Certain categories of staff members designated by the Superintendent of Schools, shall be required to use a time clock or sign in and out of work daily in order to verify days and hours worked.
The service of extra-duty personnel must be certified by the appropriate supervisor before payment can be made.
The School Business Administrator/Board Secretary is authorized to withhold salary or wages for services not rendered, in accordance with Board policy.
Staff members shall be paid in accordance with the provisions in their collective bargaining agreement and/or in accordance with a schedule provided to all employees prior to the beginning of the contract or school year.
In accordance with N.J.A.C.
6A:23A-5.7, beginning with the 2008-2009 school year, at least once every three years, between the months of September through May, the Superintendent of Schools shall require each district employee to report to a central location(s) and produce picture identification and sign for release of his or her paycheck or direct deposit voucher.
The accepted picture identification shall be in the form of a district-issued identification card, valid drivers’ license, official passport, or other picture identification issued by a State, county, or other local government agency.
The Superintendent of Schools shall designate an appropriately qualified staff member to match the picture identification to the position control roster maintained by the office of personnel or human resources prior to release of the pay check or direct deposit voucher.
If the district elects to conduct this payroll verification prior to the district’s required implementation of the position control roster pursuant to N.J.A.C.
6A:23A-6.8, the district may use similar and suitable office of personnel or human resources generated listing of employees.
Where no appropriate identification can be produced, the School Business Administrator/Board Secretary shall withhold paychecks or stop direct deposits until such time the payee/district employee can produce appropriate identification or until an investigation and corrective action is concluded, as appropriate to the circumstances.
Upon completion of the payroll check distribution verification procedures set forth in this Policy and N.J.A.C.
