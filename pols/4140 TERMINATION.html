The Board of Education will enter a contract with each non-tenured support staff member providing, in part, for the termination of employment by either party.
The Board may terminate the employment of an employee for incompetence, immorality, unfitness for service, insubordination, reduction in force, or other good cause.
Any notification of termination for cause will include a full statement of the reasons for the dismissal on notice duly given a nonprobationary employee.
The Board may terminate an employment contract with a non-tenured support staff member only upon the recommendation of the Superintendent and by a recorded roll call majority vote of the full membership of the Board.
The Board will not withhold its approval for arbitrary and capricious reasons.
