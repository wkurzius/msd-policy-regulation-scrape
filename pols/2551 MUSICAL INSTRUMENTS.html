2551 - MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS
Section: Program
Date Created: October 2009
Date Edited: October 2009
The Board of Education will purchase and maintain a supply of musical instruments for pupils enrolled in the instrumental music program.
In general, pupils are encouraged to purchase their own musical instruments.
District-owned instruments will be available to those pupils for whom the purchase of a musical instrument would impose a difficult financial burden.
District-owned instruments will be available to pupils, in the order in which requests are made, until the supply is exhausted.
If necessary, instruments will be redistributed among schools to satisfy the demand.
Instruments will be loaned only to those pupils whose parent(s) or legal guardian(s) has agreed in writing to assure the safe return of the instrument and to bear the cost of necessary repairs.
No fee will be charged for the loan of district-owned musical instruments.
Adopted:  20 October 2009
