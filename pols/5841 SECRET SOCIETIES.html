District Policy
5841 - SECRET SOCIETIES
Section: Students
Date Created: October 2009
Date Edited: October 2009
The Board of Education affirms the legislative prohibition of pupil organizations with closed membership practices as hostile to the democratic ideals of public education.
No social organization of pupils will be granted the use of school facilities or permitted the use of the name of the school or this school district unless that organization has first been approved by the Principal.
The application for such approval will set forth the purposes, constitution, and bylaws of the organization; its membership qualifications; and the process by which a person becomes a member.
No organization will be approved if its purposes conflict with the authority and goals of this Board or the best interests of the pupils of this district; if membership is drawn from outside the currently enrolled student body; if membership qualifications are based on considerations of race, color, creed, religion, national origin, ancestry, age, marital status, affectational or sexual orientation or sex, social or economic status, disability or political beliefs, or any other consideration not appropriate to the purpose of the organization; or if any qualifying pupil who applies may be denied membership.
Nothing in this policy shall prevent or otherwise deny participation in constitutionally protected prayer consistent with protections of the First Amendment of the United States Constitution.
A pupil who seeks to form or is a member of a fraternity, sorority, or other secret organization formed in whole or in part of pupils enrolled in this district may be disciplined by this Board.
The Board reserves the right to require that any pupil attest as to his/her membership in a secret organization.
