Section: Students
Date Created: October 2009
Date Edited: July 2024
The Board of Education prohibits certain student organizations declared harmful as defined in N.J.S.A.
18A:42-5 and 18A:42-6.
No student organization will be granted the use of school facilities or permitted the use of the name of the school or this school district unless that organization has first been approved by the Principal or designee.
The application for such approval will set forth the purposes, constitution, and bylaws of the organization; its membership qualifications; and the process by which a person becomes a member.
No student organization will be approved if its purposes conflict with the authority and goals of this Board or the best interests of the students of this district; if membership is drawn from outside the currently enrolled student body; if membership qualifications are based on considerations of any of the protected categories listed at N.J.A.C.
6A:7-1.1(a) or any other consideration not appropriate to the purpose of the organization; or if any qualifying student who applies may be denied membership.
Nothing in this Policy shall prevent or otherwise deny participation in constitutionally protected prayer consistent with protections of the First Amendment of the United States Constitution.
A student who seeks to form or is a member of a fraternity, sorority, or other secret organization formed in whole or in part of students enrolled in this district may be disciplined by this Board.
The Board reserves the right to require that any student attest as to their membership in a secret organization.
