The Board of Education believes that the right of persons to smoke must be balanced against the right of nonsmokers to breathe air untainted by tobacco smoke.
For the purpose of this Policy, “smoking” means the burning of, inhaling from, exhaling the smoke from, or the possession of a lighted cigar, cigarette, pipe, or any other matter or substance which contains tobacco or any other matter that can be smoked, including the use of smokeless tobacco and snuff, or the inhaling or exhaling of smoke or vapor from an electronic smoking device.
For the purpose of this Policy, “electronic smoking device” means an electronic device that can be used to deliver nicotine or other substances to the person inhaling from the device, including, but not limited to, an electronic cigarette, cigar, cigarillo, or pipe.
For the purpose of this Policy, “school buildings” and “school grounds” means and includes land, portions of land, structures, buildings, and vehicles, owned, operated, or used for the provision of academic or extracurricular programs sponsored by the district or community provider and structures that support these buildings, such as school wastewater treatment facilities, generating facilities, and other central facilities including, but not limited to kitchens and maintenance shops.
“School buildings” and “school grounds” also includes athletic stadiums; swimming pools; any associated structures or related equipment tied to such facilities including, but not limited to, grandstands; greenhouses; garages; facilities used for non-instructional or non-educational purposes; and any structure, building, or facility used solely for school administration.
“School buildings” and “school grounds” also includes other facilities as defined in N.J.A.C.
6A:26-1.2; playgrounds; and other recreational places owned by local municipalities, private entities, or other individuals during those times when the school district has exclusive use of a portion of such land.
In accordance with N.J.S.A.

A sign indicating smoking is prohibited in school buildings and on school grounds will be posted at each public entrance of a school building in accordance with law.
The sign shall also indicate violators are subject to a fine.

The Principal or designee may order the departure and removal of any person who continues to smoke in violation of this Policy and the law after being ordered to stop smoking in school buildings or on school grounds.
The Principal or designee may request the assistance of law enforcement to accomplish this departure and removal.
In the event a person is found to have violated this Policy and the law, the Principal or designee may file a complaint with the appropriate Municipal Court or other agency with jurisdiction as defined in N.J.A.C.
