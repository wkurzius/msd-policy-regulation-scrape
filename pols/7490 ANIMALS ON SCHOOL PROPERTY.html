District Policy
7490 - ANIMALS ON SCHOOL PROPERTY
Section: Property
Date Created: October 2009
Date Edited: October 2009
The Board of Education will make every reasonable effort to maintain school grounds in a condition appropriate for the activities of school pupils.
Pet animals are not permitted on school district grounds, except by the express permission of the Building Principal.
Without such permission, a pet owner who brings or permits his/her animal on school grounds has committed an act of trespass.
If an animal is found running at large on school grounds, its owner will be deemed to have permitted the animal to enter school property.
The Board directs the Building Principal to give notice regarding the prohibition of pets by posting appropriate signs on school property.
The Principal shall report to the appropriate municipal authorities any pet that runs at large on school property and any pet owner whose animal is present on school property is in violation of this policy.
Adopted:  20 October 2009
