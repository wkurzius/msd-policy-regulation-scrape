2230 - CURRICULUM GUIDES (M)
Section: Program
Date Created: October 2009
Date Edited: October 2009
M
The Board of Education directs the preparation of a guide for each approved course of study in order to direct and assist teaching staff members toward the attainment of goals addressed by that course.
Each curriculum guide will contain, as appropriate to the course of study, content standards; objectives, concepts, and skills to be taught; attitudes and appreciations to be developed; suggested activities designed to achieve the objectives; suggested methods of instruction; performance indicators; evaluation criteria intended to test the extent to which learning objectives have been achieved; and a reading list of supplemental titles for the guidance of teachers.
The curriculum guides will be the basic instructional tool for each course of study.
No teacher shall be expected to implement every suggestion made in the guide, nor shall the guide constrain a teacher from the use of ingenuity in meeting the objectives of the guide, subject to the review of the Building Principal.
The Superintendent shall be responsible for the preparation of curriculum guides, and shall develop a plan for such preparation that includes the participation of appropriate staff members and resource personnel; the participation of members of the community; the participation of pupils at appropriate grade levels; continuing research in instructional methods, materials, and activities; systematic review of all curriculum guides to ensure their continuing usefulness in achieving goals set by the Board; and a system of administrative review to ensure that curriculum guides are being followed by teaching staff members to the degree of conformity desired by the Board.
All new curriculum guides and revisions of existing guides shall be submitted to the Board for approval before they are implemented.
Copies of all current curriculum guides shall be kept on file in the office of the Superintendent.
