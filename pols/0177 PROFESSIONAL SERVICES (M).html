In accordance with N.J.A.C.
6A:23A-5.2, the Board of Education adopts this Policy and its strategies to minimize the cost of professional services.
The Board of Education will establish annually prior to budget preparation a maximum dollar limit for each type of professional service.
In the event it becomes necessary to exceed the established maximum dollar limit for the professional services, the Superintendent of Schools shall recommend to the Board of Education an increase in the maximum dollar amount.
Any increase in the maximum dollar amount shall require formal Board action.
Contracts for professional services will be issued by the Board in a deliberative and efficient manner that ensures the district receives the highest quality services at a fair and competitive price or through a shared service arrangement.
This may include, but is not limited to, issuance of such contracts through a Request for Proposals (RFP) based on cost and other specified factors or other comparable processes.
Contracts for professional services shall be limited to non-recurring or specialized work for which the district does not possess adequate in-house resources or in-house expertise to conduct.
Nothing in this Policy or N.J.A.C.
6A:23A-5.2 shall preclude the Board from complying with the requirements of any statute, administrative code, or regulation for the award of professional services contracts.
