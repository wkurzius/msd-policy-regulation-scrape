4230 - OUTSIDE ACTIVITIES
Section: Support Staff
Date Created: October 2009
Date Edited: November 2014
The Board of Education recognizes that support staff members enjoy a private life outside their job responsibilities in the school district.
The Board believes that school employees exert a continuing influence away from the school district.
Accordingly, the Board reserves the right to determine if activities outside the support staff member’s job responsibilities interfere with their performance and the discharge of the support staff member’s responsibilities to this district.
All support staff members are advised to be governed in their activities outside the school by the following guidelines:
1.
Support staff members shall not devote time during their work day to an outside private enterprise, business, or business organization.
They shall not solicit or accept customers for a private enterprise, business, and/or business organization on school grounds during their work day without the express permission of the Superintendent;
2.
The Board does not endorse, support, or assume liability in any way for any support staff member of this district who conducts a private activity in which students or employees of this district participate;
3.
Support staff members shall not send campaign literature home with students or request, direct or have students distribute campaign literature on behalf of any candidate for local, State, or national office or for any bond issue, proposal, or any public question submitted at any general, municipal, or school election.
No student shall be requested or directed by any support staff member to engage in any activity which tends to promote, favor, or oppose any such candidacy, bond issue, proposal, or public question; and
4.
Copyrights and patents to materials or equipment developed, written, prepared, processed, or tested by support staff members in the performance of their school district duties reside with and may be claimed by the Board.
