5240 - TARDINESS
Section: Students
Date Created: October 2009
Date Edited: October 2009
The Board of Education believes that promptness is an important element of school attendance.
Pupils who are late to school or to class miss essential portions of the instructional program and create disruptions in the academic process for themselves and other pupils.
Tardiness to school or class that is caused by a pupil's illness, an emergency in the pupil's family, the observance of a religious holiday, a death in the pupil's family, or by the pupil's compliance with a request or directive of an administrator will be considered justified and is excused.
All other incidents of tardiness will be considered unexcused.
Three instances of unexcused tardiness will equal one unexcused absence for the purpose of calculating unexcused absences for application of Board Policy No.
5410 on promotion and Policy No.
5460 on high school graduation.
A pupil who develops a pattern of tardiness, excused or unexcused, will be offered counseling with an appropriate staff member to determine the cause of the tardiness.
