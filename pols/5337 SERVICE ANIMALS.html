2.
A service animal shall have a harness, leash, or other tether, unless either the handler is unable because of a disability to use a harness, leash or other tether, or the use of a harness, leash, or other tether would interfere with the service animal’s safe, effective performance of work or tasks, in which case the service animal must be otherwise under the handler’s control (e.g.
voice control, signals, or other effective means).

If there are places in the district where it is determined to be unsafe for a handler and service animal, reasonable accommodations will be provided to assure the individual equal access to the activity.

The service animal is required because of a disability; and
