8330 - STUDENT RECORDS 
Section: Operations
Date Created: October 2009
Date Edited: April 2023
M
The Board of Education believes that information about individual students must be compiled and maintained in the interest of the student’s educational welfare and advancement.
The Board will strive to balance the student’s right to privacy against the district’s need to collect, retain, and use information about individual students and groups of students.
The Board authorizes the establishment and maintenance of student files that include only those records mandated by law, rules of the State Board of Education, authorized administrative directive, and those records permitted by this Board.
The Superintendent shall prepare, present to the Board for approval, and distribute regulations that implement this Policy and conform to applicable State and Federal law and rules of the State Board of Education.
General Considerations
The Board shall compile and maintain student records and regulate access in accordance with the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), 20 U.S.C.
§1232g, and 34 CFR Part 99, disclosure, or communication of information contained in student records in a manner that assures the security of the records in accordance with the provisions of N.J.A.C.
6A:32-7 et seq.
Student records shall contain only information that is relevant to the education of the student and is objectively based on the personal observations or knowledge of the certified school personnel who originate(s) the record.
The district shall provide annual, written notification to parents, adult students, and emancipated minors of their rights in regard to student records and student participation in educational, occupational, and military recruitment programs.
Copies of the applicable State and Federal laws and Board policies shall be made available upon request.
The district shall make every effort to notify parents and adult students in their dominant language.
Nonadult students may assert rights of access only through their parent(s).
However, nothing in N.J.A.C.
6A:32-7 shall be construed to prohibit certified school personnel from disclosing at their discretion student records to nonadult students or to appropriate persons in connection with an emergency, if the information contained in the record is necessary to protect the health or safety of the student or other persons.
No liability shall be attached to any member, officer, or employee of the Board permitting access or furnishing student records in accordance with N.J.A.C.
6A:32-7 et seq.
Student Information Directory
A student information directory is a publication of the Board that includes information relating to a student as defined in N.J.A.C.
6A:32-2.1.
This information includes:  name; grade level; date and place of birth; dates of school attendance; major field of study; participation in officially recognized activities; weight and height relating to athletic team membership; degrees; awards; the most recent educational agency attended by the student; and other similar information.
The student information directory shall be used only by authorized district personnel and for designated official use by judicial, law enforcement, and medical personnel and not for general public consumption.
In the event the district publishes a student information directory, the Superintendent or designee will provide a parent or adult student a ten-day period to submit to the Superintendent a written statement prohibiting the inclusion of any or all types of information about the student in any student information directory before allowing access to the directory and school facilities to educational, occupational, and military recruiters pursuant to N.J.S.A.
18A:36-19.1, P.L.
114-95 §8528, and 20 U.S.C.
§8528 - Armed Forces Recruiter Access to Students and Student Recruiting Information of the Every Student Succeeds Act of 2015.
In accordance with N.J.S.A.
18A:36-19.1, military recruiters will be provided the same access to a student information directory that is provided to educational and occupational recruiters.
School Contact Directory for Official Use
A school contact directory for official use is a compilation by the district that includes the following information for each student:  name; address; telephone number; date of birth; and school enrollment.
The district shall compile and maintain a school contact directory for official use in accordance with N.J.A.C.
6A:32-7.2, that is separate and distinct from the student information directory.
The student contact directory may be provided for official use only to judicial and law enforcement personnel, and to medical personnel currently providing services to the student in question.
To exclude any information from the school contact directory for official use the parent, adult student, or emancipated minor shall notify the Superintendent or designee in writing.
Mandated and Permitted Student Records
Mandated student records are those records districts have been directed to compile by State statute, regulations, or authorized administrative directive in accordance with N.J.A.C.
