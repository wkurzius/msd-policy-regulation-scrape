The Board of Education recognizes that experience gained by and input from students in the school district is a valued source for improving the operation of the school district.
To this end, and in accordance with N.J.S.A.
18A:12-1.3 and N.J.S.A.
18A:36A-11.2, the Board authorizes the appointment of a minimum of one student selected by the student body to serve as a nonvoting student representative on the Board.
The student representative must be selected from one of the grades nine through twelve.
The student body may elect or appoint the student representative to the Board in a process to be determined by the Superintendent or designee.
When developing the process the Superintendent or designee shall consider input provided by the student body.
The student representative shall serve for a one school year term and their duties shall include:
1.
Attending all Board meetings, excluding any discussions of the Board involving subjects which are confidential;
2.
Representing all high school students within the district and presenting student proposals and concerns to the Board for its consideration; and
3.
Keeping high school students informed of the business of the Board by providing a monthly report to the Student Council concerning the activities of the Board.
The student representative shall rotate each school year among the high schools in the district if the district has more than one high school.
Student representatives are expected to adhere to all bylaws, policies, and regulations of the Board in their role.
The Board in no way relinquishes any of its authority, powers, prerogatives, or responsibilities, but rather adds to its membership a nonvoting student representative(s) for the mutual benefit of the Board, student body, and the school district.
