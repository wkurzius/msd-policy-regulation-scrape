7480 - MOTOR VEHICLES ON SCHOOL PROPERTY
Section: Property
Date Created: October 2009
Date Edited: October 2009
The school grounds owned and maintained by this Board of Education are subject to damage by motor vehicles.
Accordingly, the Board has provided areas, adjacent to the school building, in which employees of the district and visitors to the school may drive and park motor vehicles.
The Board prohibits the use or presence of any motor vehicle, including motorcycles, all-terrain vehicles, snow mobiles, and mopeds, for any purpose on any part of the school property owned by the Board other than the driving and parking areas established by the Board except as expressly permitted by the Superintendent or designee.
The Board directs the Superintendent to have conspicuous notices posted forbidding the parking of motor vehicles in undesignated areas of the school grounds.
The Board reserves the right to prosecute in a court of competent jurisdiction any person whose violation of this rule results in damage to the property of this district.
