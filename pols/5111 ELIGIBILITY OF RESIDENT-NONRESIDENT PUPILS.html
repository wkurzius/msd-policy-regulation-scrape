The Board shall also admit any student that is kept in the home of a person other than the student’s parent or guardian, where the person is domiciled in the school district and is supporting the student without remuneration as if the student were his or her own child in accordance with N.J.A.C.

In addition, the person keeping the student must file, if so required by the Board of Education, a sworn statement that he or she:  is domiciled within the school district; is supporting the child without remuneration and intends to do so for a time longer than the school term; will assume all personal obligations for the student relative to school requirements; and provides a copy of his or her lease if a tenant, a sworn landlord’s statement if residing as a tenant without a written lease, or a mortgage or tax bill if an owner.
Pursuant to N.J.S.A.
18A:38-1.c., any person who fraudulently allows a child of another person to use his or her residence and is not the primary financial supporter of that child and any person who fraudulently claims to have given up custody of his or her child to a person in another district commits a disorderly persons offense.

Enrollment or attendance at the school shall not be conditioned on advance payment of tuition when enrollment is denied and an intent to appeal is indicated, or when enrollment is provisional and subject to further review or information.

Nothing in N.J.A.C.
