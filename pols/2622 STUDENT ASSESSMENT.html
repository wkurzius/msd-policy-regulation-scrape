State assessments provide parents with important information about their child’s progress; detailed diagnostic information about each individual student’s performance that educators, parents, and students can utilize to enhance foundational knowledge and student achievement; and include item analysis which will clarify a student’s level of knowledge and understanding of a particular subject or area of a subject.
The data derived from State assessments are utilized by teachers and administrators to pinpoint areas of difficulty and customize instruction accordingly.
Such data can be accessed and utilized as a student progresses to successive school levels.
