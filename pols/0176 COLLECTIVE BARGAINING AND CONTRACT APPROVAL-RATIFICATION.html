0176 - COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AND CONTRACT APPROVAL/RATIFICATION
Section: Bylaws
Date Created: October 2009
Date Edited: October 2009
The Board recognizes a Board member and/or a member of his/her immediate family may be a member of, or salary is determined by, a labor bargaining unit, professional association and/or union that has an affiliation with a bargaining unit, professional organization and/or union within the school district.
The Board member does not automatically violate N.J.S.A.
18A:24 by voting to approve and/or ratify this contract solely on the basis of his/her status or that of an immediate family member with respect to membership or representation by a different local affiliate of the same statewide association with whom the agreement is made provided the Board member’s involvement with such local affiliate has not or appears to have not compromised the member’s objectivity or independence of judgment.
In accordance with N.J.S.A.
18A:12-24, the Board member shall not participate in the collective bargaining process and/or serve on the negotiations committee representing the Board with this unit, association, and/or union.
The Board member may be apprised of the terms of a tentative memorandum of agreement with this unit, association, and/or union in closed and/or open session only after a tentative memorandum of agreement has been reached.
The Board member may vote during the public meeting to approve and/or ratify a contract with this bargaining unit, professional association and/or union.
The Board member shall not participate in any aspect of negotiations and/or vote to approve/ratify a tentative memorandum of agreement/contract ratification if the Board member has an immediate family who is a member of the bargaining unit, professional association and/or union within the school district.
Under this circumstance, the Board member may only vote in the event the school Board attorney advises the Board the Doctrine of Necessity must be invoked in accordance with Policy No.
0163.
In addition, the School Ethics Commission Decision A16-00 states a Board member may not participate in any aspect of negotiations and/or vote to approve/ratify a tentative memorandum of agreement/contract ratification if the Board member has a “relative” who is a member of the bargaining unit, professional association and/or union within the school district.
Under this circumstance, the Board member may only vote in the event the school Board attorney advises the Board the Doctrine of Necessity must be invoked in accordance with Policy No.
