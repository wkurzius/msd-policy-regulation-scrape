Section: Administration
Date Created: October 2009
Date Edited: October 2009
The Board of Education believes that it is the primary duty of the Board to establish policies and the primary duty of the Superintendent to implement and administer those policies.
The Superintendent, as Chief Administrative Officer of the school district, is the primary professional advisor to the Board.
Policy should not be adopted or revised without consultation with the Superintendent.
The Superintendent is responsible for the development, supervision, and operation of the school program and facilities and will be given latitude to implement and administer policies in accordance with such standards as may have been set forth in the policies.
The Superintendent will discharge his/her responsibility in part through the establishment and promulgation of administrative regulations.
In evaluating the effectiveness of Board policy in meeting the goals of the district, the Board will request the Superintendent to make appropriate inquiries, investigations, and reports.
