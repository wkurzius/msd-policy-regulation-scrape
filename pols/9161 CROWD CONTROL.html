9161 - CROWD CONTROL
Section: Community
Date Created: October 2009
Date Edited: October 2009
The Board of Education believes in order to achieve its goals for interscholastic competition, the student body and the general public attending an interscholastic event conduct themselves in such a manner as to make a positive contribution toward the educational objectives of this district.
The Board directs the Superintendent to prepare regulations for pupil and public behavior at interscholastic events and to publicly post such regulations and to devise procedures for the control of crowds.
The Board authorizes school officials to have expelled from any district event by the law enforcement officers on duty, any spectator who willfully violates the rules and regulations of the district or whose behavior jeopardizes the safe conduct of the event.
Further, any spectator involved in continual violations of the rules and regulations shall be prohibited from attending further school events.
Adopted:  20 October 2009
