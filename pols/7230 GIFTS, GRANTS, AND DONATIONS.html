7230 - GIFTS, GRANTS, AND DONATIONS
Section: Property
Date Created: October 2009
Date Edited: October 2009
The Board of Education accepts its responsibility to provide from public funds sufficient supplies and equipment for an effective instructional program.
The Board recognizes, however, that from time to time individuals or organizations in the community may wish to contribute additional supplies or equipment to enhance or extend the instructional program.
The Board may accept by resolution duly passed at a public meeting any gift or grant of land, with or without improvement, and of money or other personal property, except that the Superintendent may accept on behalf of the Board any such gift less than $50.00 in value.
Grants of land are subject to the appropriate legal limitations and approvals.
The Board reserves the right to refuse to accept any gift that does not contribute toward the achievement of the goals of this district or any gift the ownership of which would tend to deplete the resources of the district.
The Board shall not provide public moneys for the purchase of any school property on a matching fund basis.
Any gift accepted by the Board shall become the property of the Board, may not be returned without the approval of the Board, and shall be subject to the same controls and regulations as are other properties of the Board.
The Board shall be responsible for the maintenance of any gift it accepts, subject to any joint agreement with another governmental body.
The Board will respect the intent of the donor in its use of a gift, but reserves the right to utilize any gift it accepts in the best interests of the pupils and the educational program of the district.
In no case shall acceptance of a gift be considered to be an endorsement by the Board of a commercial product or business enterprise or institution of learning.
The Superintendent shall:
1.
Counsel potential donors on the appropriateness of contemplated gifts and encourage such donors to choose as gifts supplies or equipment not likely to be purchased with public funds;
2.
Encourage individuals and organizations considering a contribution to the schools to consult with the Principal or Superintendent before appropriating funds to that end;
3.
Report to the Board all gifts that have been accepted on behalf of the Board;
4.
Acknowledge the receipt of any gift accepted by the Board; and
5.
Prepare fitting means for recognizing or memorializing gifts to the school district.
