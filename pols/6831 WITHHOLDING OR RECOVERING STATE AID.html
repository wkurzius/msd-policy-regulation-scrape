Date Created: October 2009
Date Edited: October 2009
In the event the New Jersey Department of Education identifies ineffective or inefficient expenditure(s) by any school district, including, but not limited to the practices prohibited in N.J.A.C.
6A:23A-5.2 through 5.9, the Commissioner shall, except as otherwise provided in N.J.A.C.
6A:23A-5.1(h) provide the school district the opportunity to be heard as to why the amount of the ineffective or inefficient expenditure(s) shall not be withheld from State aid or refunded to the Department of Education.
The proceeding shall be instituted by an Order to Show Cause filed by the petitioner.
The filing shall include a statement of factual findings along with a letter memorandum setting forth the basis for the position that the expenditure(s) was ineffective or inefficient.
The respondent(s) to whom the order is directed shall file, within fifteen days, a response to the letter memorandum and an answer that meets the filing, service, and format requirements for answers as set forth in N.J.A.C.
6A:3, Controversies and Disputes.
The petitioner may file a reply to the response within ten days.
Upon review of the filings, the Commissioner may decide to hear the matter directly pursuant to N.J.S.A.
52:14F-8 or refer the matter to the Office of Administrative Law.
If the Commissioner decides to transmit the matter to the Office of Administrative Law, such transmission shall be done on an expedited basis.
If the Commissioner is hearing the matter directly, upon receipt of the filings set forth above, or upon expiration of the time for their submission, the Commissioner shall review the total record before him or her and render a written decision.
The Commissioner’s decision shall include a determination of whether the expenditure was ineffective or inefficient and, if so, the amount of funds to be withheld from State aid or refunded by the district.
Nothing shall preclude the Commissioner from immediately and summarily withholding State aid, consistent with N.J.S.A.
18A:55-2, if, at any time, it is determined that the fiscal practices, actions, or expenditures of a school official, Board member, Board, or any other party under the Commissioner’s jurisdiction are in violation of any statute, regulation, rule, or directive of the State Board of Education or Commissioner of Education.
