7130 - SCHOOL CLOSING
Section: Property
Date Created: October 2009
Date Edited: October 2009
The Board of Education recognizes its responsibility to provide a thorough and efficient program of free public education and appropriate facilities to house that program.
The Board further recognizes that declining enrollments, diminished resources, district reorganization, or other good cause may require that the use of one or more district facilities for educational purposes be abandoned.
The Board will not commit itself to the closing of any school facility without first having collected and considered appropriate information regarding pupil enrollments, the educational adequacy of school facilities, relevant safety and traffic factors, district revenues, and alternative district organizational plans.
The Board will invite citizen participation in the analysis of that information and the formulation of recommendations.
Information on any proposed district reorganization will be disseminated to the public, and public response will be invited by all appropriate means.
The Board must receive a letter of approval from the Department of Education before making a final determination to close a school.
To receive the letter of approval from the Department of Education, the Board must provide the Division of Facilities and Transportation and the County Superintendent of Schools assurances as required in N.J.A.C.
6A:26-7.5.
The proposed closing must be consistent with the districtâ€™s approved LRFP, demonstrating that sufficient school building capacity exists to house district pupils following such closing for the succeeding five years.
The use of substandard spaces in the remaining schools within the district must not result or increase from an overall facilities shortage caused by the school closing.
The re-assignment of pupils to other schools in the district does not produce, sustain nor contribute to unlawful segregation, separation or isolation of pupil populations on the basis of race or national origin.
