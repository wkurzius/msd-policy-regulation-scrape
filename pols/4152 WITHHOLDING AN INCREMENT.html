4152 - WITHHOLDING AN INCREMENT
Section: Support Staff
Date Created: October 2009
Date Edited: October 2009
The Board of Education recognizes that any advancement on a salary schedule, including annual increments and raises, is not automatic but rests within the discretion of the Board.
Advancement on any salary schedule shall require favorable reports covering the employee's competence and thoroughness in the performance of assigned duties as well as the employee's record of attendance and compliance with district regulations.
The Superintendent shall base a recommendation for withholding an increment on evaluations of the employee's performance and conduct.
The Superintendent must also show to the satisfaction of the Board that the standards by which an employee has been evaluated are not exceptional or unusual and are expected of all employees in a similar classification.
