The Board of Education prohibits the possession, use, or exchange of any weapon in any school building, on school grounds, at any school-sponsored event, and on school sanctioned transportation except as the possession and use of a weapon is authorized by law and required in the performance of the possessor's duty.
For the purpose of this policy, "weapon" means anything readily capable of lethal use or of inflicting serious bodily injury.
"Weapon" includes, but is not limited to, all firearms, knives, dangerous instruments intended to inflict harm, components that can be readily assembled into a weapon, explosive devices, and imitation firearms.
For the purposes of this policy “firearm” means those items enumerated in N.J.S.A.

Any pupil or school employee who has reasonable grounds to suspect the presence of a weapon prohibited by this policy shall immediately report his/her suspicion to the Building Principal.
The Building Principal shall conduct an appropriate search in accordance with Policy No.
5770 and confiscate any weapon discovered in the course of the search.
He/she shall, if appropriate and feasible, summon the aid of law enforcement officers in the conduct of the search.
Any school employee who confirms the presence of a weapon under circumstances that place persons at serious risk may confiscate the weapon immediately and may use such force as is reasonable and necessary to obtain possession.
Unless the weapon has been taken into custody by a law enforcement officer, the Building Principal shall immediately store any confiscated weapon in a securely locked box or container and report the presence of the weapon to the Superintendent.
The Superintendent shall promptly notify, by telephone call and by letter, the Chief of Police of Manville Police Department that a weapon is present on school premises; the notice shall request removal of the weapon by an authorized law enforcement officer.
The Superintendent shall obtain and file a receipt for any weapon removed by a law enforcement officer.
Any pupil who possesses, uses, or exchanges a weapon in violation of this policy shall be subject to stringent discipline, which may include expulsion.
Any pupil or school employee who suspects or knows of the presence of a weapon in violation of this policy and fails to report the same shall be subject to discipline.
Any person who possesses a weapon on school premises or school transportation or at a school-sponsored function shall be reported to the appropriate law enforcement agency.
Any pupil who is convicted or is an adjudicated delinquent for possession of a firearm or who is found to be in possession of a firearm on school property must be immediately removed from the regular education program and provided with an alternative program, pending a hearing before the Board of Education.
Pupils convicted or found to be delinquent for possessing a firearm on school property, on a school bus, or at a school-sponsored function or committing a crime while possessing a firearm shall be immediately removed from the regular education program for a period of not less than one calendar year and placed in an alternative education school or program pending a hearing before the Board of Education to remove the pupil.
