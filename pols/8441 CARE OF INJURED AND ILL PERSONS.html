M
The Board of Education will provide the prompt and appropriate medical attention for students, staff members, or visitors who are injured or become ill on school grounds or during a school sponsored event, activity, or field trip.
Any injury or illness shall be reported immediately to the school nurse or, in the absence of the school nurse, the Building Principal or designee.
Immediate steps may be taken as necessary to remove the injured or ill person from danger and/or to prevent exacerbation of the injury or illness.
Basic first aid may be administered by district personnel to ensure the safety and comfort of the injured or ill person until the school nurse or other medical professional arrives on the scene.
The parent of an injured or ill student and, if necessary, the family of an injured or ill staff member or visitor will be notified promptly of the injury or illness and the ongoing health status of the injured or ill person.
If the school nurse or school physician or, in the absence of both, the Principal or designee determines the injured or ill person should receive a medical examination from their medical professional, the parent or family member will be required to remove the injured or ill person from the school or school event or activity.
In the event a serious health emergency occurs on school grounds or during a school sponsored event, activity, or field trip, emergency medical assistance will be contacted.
In the event it is determined by the school nurse and/or a medical professional that a student shall be immediately transported to a hospital or other emergency medical facility, a school staff member, if a parent or their designee is not on the scene, shall accompany the student to a hospital or other emergency medical facility.
The school nurse(s), in consultation with the school physician, will develop basic emergency first aid procedures for the emergency treatment of an injury or illness in the event a school staff member may be in the position to provide emergency first aid until the school nurse or other medical professional arrives on the scene.
Injuries and disabilities that occur in the course of the athletic program are subject to the provisions of Policy 2431 and implementing regulations.
Student disabilities attributable to substance abuse will be handled in accordance with Policy 5530.
Injuries that occur in the course of school bus transportation will be handled in accordance with regulations implementing Policy 8630.
