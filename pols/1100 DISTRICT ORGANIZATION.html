District Policy
1100 - DISTRICT ORGANIZATION
Section: Administration
Date Created: October 2009
Date Edited: October 2009
The Board of Education directs the establishment and implementation of an organizational plan for the management and control of school district operations.
The plan will require the identification and resolution of problems at appropriate organizational levels.
All references to school district administrators in policies or regulations shall be construed to mean that administrator or his/her designee.
All members and employees of this Board are directed to observe faithfully the chain of communications established by the district organizational plan.
In general, a problem should be identified and its resolution attempted at the level most immediate to the problem's origin.
When a resolution cannot be found at that level, remedy may be sought through appropriate resolution and remediation procedures.
The Board expressly disapproves of any attempt to expedite the resolution of a problem by disregard of the organizational plan and the appropriate processes.
A staff member's persistent disregard for the established management organization of this district in violation of this policy will be considered an act of insubordination subject to discipline.
