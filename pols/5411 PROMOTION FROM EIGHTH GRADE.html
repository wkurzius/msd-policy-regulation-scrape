Section: Students
Date Created: October 2009
Date Edited: September 2011
The Board of Education will recognize with fitting ceremonies a pupil's completion of the program of studies offered by this district in elementary school and the pupil's entrance to secondary school.
Successful completion of the program of studies in elementary school requires achievement of the instructional objectives set for each course of study, demonstration of mastery of the proficiencies established for each course, and a satisfactory attendance record in alignment with district Policy 5200 Attendance.
If a pupil fails three academic subjects (language arts, mathematics, science and social studies), he or she may not be promoted.
If a pupil fails two academic subjects, he or she must attend summer school and pass at least one of those subjects to be promoted.
If a pupil fails only one academic subject, he or she may be promoted but the pupil will be strongly encouraged to attend summer school for the academic subject failed.
The parent(s) or legal guardian(s) of a pupil who may be prevented from graduating shall be so notified in advance and no later than six weeks prior to the close of the school year.
Every effort shall be made to remediate a pupil's deficiencies before graduation is denied.
The requirements for promotion from elementary school of a disabled pupil shall be set forth in the pupil's individualized education program.
Completion of those specialized requirements shall qualify the pupil for graduation and entry to secondary school.
For any pupil in grades 6 â€“ 8 failing by the end of the second marking period with the possibility of being retained in the same grade level, the Principal will meet with the parent(s) or legal guardian(s) and teachers to establish intervention strategies that will enable the pupil to be promoted.
When evaluation of the pupil's progress does not indicate such growth, the Principal shall notify the Superintendent by April 1 and the pupil's parent(s) or legal guardian(s) by April 15 of the possibility of retention.
The Principal, after consultation with teachers, parent(s) or legal guardian(s), and appropriate school personnel, shall decide whether to promote a pupil or retain him/her at grade level; attendance and truancy factors will be reviewed in alignment with Policy 5200 Attendance will be a consideration.
The Principal is also responsible for informing the Superintendent by June 1 of the tentative list of pupils being retained and the final list as soon as it is available.
