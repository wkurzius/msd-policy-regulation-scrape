2435 - NJSIAA RANDOM TESTING FOR INTERSCHOLASTIC ATHLETICS
Section: Program
Date Created: October 2009
Date Edited: October 2009
The Board of Education recognizes the use of harmful performance enhancing substances seriously threatens the health, safety, and welfare of pupil-athletes that participate in interscholastic athletics.
This district’s secondary school is a member of the New Jersey State Interscholastic Athletic Association (NJSIAA).
It is a violation of NJSIAA’s sportsmanship rule for any pupil-athlete to possess, ingest, or otherwise use any substance on NJSIAA’s list of banned substances, without written prescription by a fully licensed physician, recognized by the American Medical Association, to treat a specific medical condition.
Therefore, NJSIAA, in accordance with Executive Order 72, will test a random selection of pupil-athletes who have qualified, as individuals or as members of a team, for NJSIAA sanctioned State championship competition.
The list of banned substances, for the purposes of this Policy, shall be prepared and published by NJSIAA.
Before participating in interscholastic sports, the pupil-athlete and their parent or guardian shall consent to random testing in accordance with NJSIAA’s Steroid Testing Policy by completing and submitting to the school district NJSIAA’s Consent To Random Testing Form.
NJSIAA’s list of banned substances shall be attached to the consent form and the consent form must be signed each school year.
The failure to sign the consent form shall render the pupil-athlete ineligible to participate in all interscholastic sports until the form is signed.
The signed Consent To Random Testing Forms shall be maintained in the Building Principal’s office.
Pupil-athletes will be selected to be tested on a random basis from all athletes participating in championship competition in accordance with NJSIAA procedures.
The test will analyze a urine sample.
The methodology for taking and handling samples shall be in accordance with current legal standards and tests shall be administered by a certified laboratory designated by NJSIAA.
No test shall be considered a positive result unless the approved laboratory reports a positive result and NJSIAA’s medical review officer confirms there was no medical reason for the positive result.
The sample will be split when taken and shall be available in the event of an appeal.
A positive test result may be appealed in accordance with NJSIAA’s appeal procedures.
Results of all tests shall be considered confidential and shall only be disclosed to the individual, his or her parent(s) or legal guardian(s), and his or her school.
It is NJSIAA’s Policy that any person who tests positive in an NJSIAA administered test, or any person who refuses to provide a testing sample when identified, or any person who reports his or her own violation, shall immediately forfeit his or her eligibility to participate in NJSIAA competition for a period of one year from the date of the test.
Any such person shall also forfeit any individual honor earned while in violation.
No person who tests positive, refuses to provide a sample, or who reports his or own violation shall resume eligibility until he or she has undergone counseling and produced a negative test result.
NJSIAA’s Policy shall not prevent the school district from disciplining a pupil for violating the district’s substance abuse policies or practices and a violation of a school district’s testing program will not be reported to NJSIAA.
NJSIAA’s Executive Committee shall annually compile and report the results of the Steroid Testing Policy and determine whether the Policy shall be renewed or discontinued.
