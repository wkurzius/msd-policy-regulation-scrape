5513 - CARE OF SCHOOL PROPERTY 
Section: Students
Date Created: October 2009
Date Edited: September 2022
M
The Board of Education believes the school district should help students learn to respect property and instill feelings of pride in their school.
The Board requires each student in the district to responsibly care for school property and the school supplies and equipment entrusted to the student by the school district.
Students who cause damage to or lose school property may be subject to disciplinary measures.
The Board authorizes the imposition of a fine for the loss, damage, or destruction of a textbook or district issued technology and reserves the right to withhold a report card or diploma from any student whose payment of a fine is in arrears.
A student who demonstrates chronic and/or serious disregard for property may be referred to the Child Study Team.
The Superintendent shall develop rules for the safekeeping and accounting of textbooks and district issued technology and prepare a schedule of fines for lost, damaged, and destroyed textbooks and district issued technology.
