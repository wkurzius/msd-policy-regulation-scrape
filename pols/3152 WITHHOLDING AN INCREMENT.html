District Policy
3152 - WITHHOLDING AN INCREMENT
Section: Teaching Staff Members
Date Created: October 2009
Date Edited: October 2009
Advancements on the salary guide, including annual employment and adjustment increments, are not automatically granted and must be earned by satisfactory performance.
Advancements require favorable evaluations of the employee's performance of assigned duties, a satisfactory attendance record, and adherence to the rules of this district and high standards of professional conduct.
The Board of Education may determine, by recorded roll call majority vote of the full membership and at any time prior to the commencement of the school year or contract year in which the employee's salary will vest, to withhold any or all of the increments indicated by the salary guide or by Board policy.
In no case will the Board withhold a portion of an increment.
The Board shall, within ten days of its formal action to withhold an increment, give written notice to the affected employee of both the action and the reason or reasons for which it was taken.
The purpose of the Board in withholding increments is to improve the educational program and encourage the highest possible professional performance of its employees.
Accordingly, all reasonable efforts will be made to inform employees of any deficiencies that may result in the withholding of an increment and to assist them in the correction of those deficiencies.
An increment withheld may be restored only by action of the Board.
Nothing in this policy shall limit the right of a successor Board to restore an employee from whom an increment or increments have been withheld to that place on the salary guide he/she would have achieved had the increment or increments not been withheld.
