5516 - USE OF ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATION AND RECORDING DEVICES (ECRD) M
Section: Students
Date Created: October 2009
Date Edited: October 2016
M
The Board of Education believes students and/or school staff members should not be subject to having a video or audio recording taken of any student(s) or school staff member(s) for any purpose without the consent of the student, the student’s parent, and/or the school staff member.
In addition to protecting the privacy rights of students and school staff members, the Board recognizes such recordings can be disruptive to the educational program.
In addition, inappropriate recordings of educational material, student assessment instruments, and/or student assessment reviews can be used to compromise the integrity of the district’s educational program or lead to academic dishonesty in the event such recordings are stored and/or transmitted to other students.
Therefore, the Board of Education adopts this Policy regarding student use of electronic communication and recording devices.
“Electronic communication and recording device (ECRD)” includes any device with the capability to audio or video record or is capable of receiving or transmitting any type of communication between persons.
An ECRD includes, but is not limited to, cameras, cellular and wireless telephones, pagers/beepers, laptop computers,  chrome books, ipads, electronic readers, personal digital assistants (PDAs), two-way radios, portable fax machines, video broadcasting devices, and any other device that allows a person to record and/or transmit, on either a real time or delayed basis, sound, video, or still images, text, or other information.
A student is not permitted to have turned on or use an ECRD on school grounds during the school day or when the student is participating in a curricular or school-sponsored co-curricular activity.
A student’s personal ECRD may only be used on school grounds in an emergency situation or before and after the school day or with the permission of a school staff member supervising the student in a curricular or school-sponsored co-curricular activity.
Any audio and/or video recording by a student using their personal ECRD with permission of a school staff member while participating in a curricular or school-sponsored activity where other students or staff members are present shall require the permission for such recording from any other student and their parents and/or staff members whose voice or image is to be recorded.
This Policy is not intended to prohibit appropriate use of electronic devices for authorized or approved official curricular or school-sponsored co-curricular activities such as yearbook photographs, staff member/teacher-directed and approved activities, classroom presentations, athletic events, and drama production filming.
A student authorized or approved to use an ECRD may not use an ECRD to access internet sites or view information or internet-based material that is inappropriate or would be blocked from student access by the school district’s acceptable use of computers and networks policy.
Nothing in this Policy is intended to prevent a student from using their personal ECRD and recording school-sponsored co-curricular activities as a non-participant when the activity is open to the general public.
For the purposes of this policy, “school grounds” means and includes land, portions of land, structures, buildings, and structures that support these buildings, including, but not limited to, administrative buildings, kitchens, maintenance shops, and garages.
“School grounds” also includes other facilities as defined in N.J.A.C.
6A:26-1.2, playgrounds, and other recreational places owned by the local municipalities, private entities, or other individuals during those times when the school district has exclusive use of a portion of such land.
An ECRD used in violation of this Policy will be confiscated by a school staff member or Principal or designee and the student will be subject to appropriate disciplinary action.
A student shall not knowingly bring or possess any remotely activated paging device on any school grounds, including on a school bus or at a school-sponsored function, at any time and regardless of whether school is in session or other persons are present.
The student must submit a new request if the time in which permission is given to bring and/or possess a device expires.
The student that is granted permission to possess and/or bring the device must be in the possession of the device at all times.
The Principal or designee shall immediately notify the Superintendent of Schools and the appropriate criminal justice or juvenile justice agency if a student brings or possesses a remotely activated paging device in violation of N.J.S.A.
2C:33-19 and this Policy.
The Principal or designee will confiscate the remotely activated paging device, take appropriate disciplinary action and shall immediately notify the Superintendent of Schools and the appropriate criminal justice or juvenile justice agency if a student brings or possesses a remotely activated paging device in violation of  N.J.S.A.
2C:33-19 and this Policy.
