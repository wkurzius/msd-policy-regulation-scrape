6350 - COMPETITIVE CONTRACTING
Section: Finances
Date Created: October 2009
Date Edited: October 2009
Competitive contracting may be used in lieu of public bidding for specialized goods or services that exceed the bid threshold provided the process is administered by a purchasing agent, by legal counsel of the Board of Education, or by the School Business Administrator and pursuant to N.J.S.A.
18A:18A-4.1.
et seq.
Competitive contracting may only be used for the purposes provided in N.J.S.A.
18A:18A-4.1.
Unless an exception is provided for under N.J.S.A.
18A:18A-42 permitting a longer contract duration, contracts awarded under competitive contracting may be for a term not to exceed five years.
The purchasing agent will prepare a request for proposal documentation, which will include all requirements deemed appropriate and necessary to allow for full and free competition between vendors, information necessary for potential vendors to submit a proposal, and a methodology by which the Board will evaluate and rank proposals received from vendors.
The methodology for the awarding of competitive contracts will be based on an evaluation and ranking and will be developed in a way that is intended to meet the specific needs of the district and where such criteria will not unfairly or illegally discriminate against or exclude otherwise capable vendors.
The methodology for awarding competitive contracts will comply with such rules and regulations as the Director of the Division of Local Government Services in the Department of Community Affairs may adopt in accordance with N.J.S.A.
18A-4.4.
Request for Proposal documentation will be published in an official newspaper of the Board at least twenty days prior to the date established for the submission of proposals.
The Board may charge a fee for the proposal documentation that will not exceed $50.00 or the cost of reproducing the documentation, whichever is greater.
Each interested vendor will be required to submit a proposal which will include all the information required by the request for proposals.
Failure to meet the requirements of the request for proposals may result in the Board disqualifying the vendor from further consideration.
Under no circumstances will the provisions of a proposal be subject to negotiation by the Board.
If the Board, at the time of solicitation, utilizes its own employees to provide the goods or perform the services, or both considered for competitive contracting, the Board will, at any time prior to, but no later than the time of solicitation for competitive contracting proposals, notify affected employees of the Board's intention to solicit competitive contracting proposals pursuant to N.J.S.A.
18A:18A-4.5.c.
Employees or their representatives will be permitted to submit recommendations and proposals affecting wages, hours, and terms and conditions of employment in such a manner as to meet the goals of the competitive contract.
If employees are represented by an organization that has negotiated a contract with the Board, only the bargaining unit will be authorized to submit such recommendations or proposals.
When requested by such employees, the Board will provide such information regarding budgets and the costs of performing the services by such employees as may be available.
Nothing will prevent such employees from making recommendations that may include modifications to existing labor agreements in order to reduce such costs in lieu of award of a competitive contract, and agreements implementing such recommendations may be considered as cause for rejecting all other proposals.
The purchasing agent will evaluate all proposals only in accordance with the methodology described in the request for proposals.
After proposals have been evaluated, the purchasing agent will prepare a report evaluating and recommending the award of a contract or contracts.
The report will be prepared pursuant to N.J.S.A.
18A:18A-4.5.d.
The report will be made available to the public at least 48 hours prior to the awarding of the contract, or when made available to the Board, whichever is sooner.
The Board will have the right to reject all proposals for any of the reasons set forth in N.J.S.A.
18A:18A-22.
Award of a contract will be made by resolution of the Board within sixty days of the receipt of the proposals, except that the proposals of any vendors who consent thereto, may, at the request of the Board, be held for consideration for such longer period as may be agreed.
The report prepared pursuant to this Policy and Regulation No.
6350 will become part of the public record and will reflect the final action of the Board.
Contracts will be executed pursuant to N.J.S.A.
18A:18A-40.
The Secretary of the Board will publish a notice in the official newspaper of the Board summarizing the award of a contract pursuant to N.J.S.A.
18A:18A-4.5g.
N.J.S.A.
18A:18A-1 et seq.
Adopted:  20 October 2009
