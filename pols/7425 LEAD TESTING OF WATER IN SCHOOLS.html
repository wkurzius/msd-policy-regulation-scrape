Section: Property
Date Created: April 2021
Date Edited: April 2021
The health, safety, and welfare of the children in the school district are of utmost importance to the Board of Education.
The potential exposure to                               lead-contaminated drinking water poses serious health problems, particularly for children, as well as for teachers and school personnel, since the risk of lead contamination can come from pipe and plumbing fixtures in school facilities or on school grounds.
The Board shall assure the availability of potable drinking water through sanitary means in school facilities or on school grounds.
The Board of Education shall provide, in accordance with N.J.A.C.
6A:26-12.4, testing for lead in all district sources of drinking water.
The Board shall conduct lead sampling and analysis in all drinking water outlets to which a student or staff member has, or may have, access in each school facility, other facility, or temporary facility, as soon as practicable, but no later than July 13, 2017, unless the district qualifies for an exemption in accordance with N.J.A.C.
6A:26-12.4(j).
This lead sampling and analysis shall be conducted with a lead sampling plan in accordance with N.J.A.C.
6A:26-12.4(d)1, 2, and 3, and shall be in accordance with the Safe Drinking Water Act, N.J.S.A.
58:12A-1.
The Superintendent of Schools or designee shall complete a review of the final laboratory results within seventy-two hours of receipt.
Within twenty-four hours after the Superintendent or designee has completed a review of final laboratory results in accordance with the provisions of N.J.A.C.
6A:26-12.4(e), the test results shall be made publicly available at the school facility and on the Board of Education’s website.
If any results exceed the permissible lead action level, the Board shall provide written notification to the parents of all students attending the facility, facility staff, and the New Jersey Department of Education.
This written notification shall include:  a description of the measures taken by the Superintendent or designee to immediately end the use of each drinking water outlet where the water quality exceeded the permissible lead action level; any additional remedial action taken or planned by the Board of Education; the measures taken to ensure that alternate drinking water has been made available to all students and staff members; where the water outlet(s) is located; and information regarding the health effects of lead in accordance with N.J.A.C.
6A:26-12.4(e)1 and 2.
Notwithstanding the results or date of any prior testing, the Board shall continue to test drinking water outlets in the designated Statewide required testing year, which shall be every third school year beginning with the    2021-2022 school year and subsequently occurring in the 2024-2025 school year.
By no later than June 30 of the designated Statewide required testing year, the Board shall test all drinking water outlets in accordance with N.J.A.C.
6A:26-12.4(g)1.
The Board shall sample for lead after the replacement of any drinking water outlet or any other alteration to plumbing or service lines that may impact lead levels at the outlet, in accordance with N.J.A.C.
6A:26-12.4 (g) 2.
The Board shall submit to the New Jersey Department of Education by June 30 of each year a statement of assurance, that the school district completed lead testing in accordance with N.J.A.C.
6A:26-12.4; that notifications were provided consistent with N.J.A.C.
6A:26-12.4; and that alternative drinking water continues to be made available to all students and staff, if necessary, pursuant to N.J.A.C.
6A:26-12.4(i).
The Board may apply for reimbursement for the costs of any water supply testing and analysis conducted, in accordance with N.J.A.C.
