4322 - STAFF MEMBER’S USE OF CELLULAR TELEPHONES
Section: Support Staff
Date Created: October 2009
Date Edited: October 2009
The Manville Board of Education recognizes a school support staff member may have the need to make a personal telephone call during their workday when the telephone call cannot be made before the staff member reports to work and/or after the staff member’s workday has concluded.
In the event the staff member has an occasion to make a personal telephone call during their workday, and the telephone call is of such a nature that it cannot be made before the staff member’s workday begins or after the workday has concluded, the school staff member may make a personal telephone call using their personal cellular telephone during the workday provided the telephone call is made during the staff member’s free lunch/break periods and is made outside the presence of pupils in an area inside the school building designated the staff member’s Building Principal or immediate supervisor.
A personal telephone call by a support staff member on their personal cellular telephone shall not be made while the support staff member is performing assigned school district responsibilities.
In the event the staff member has an emergency requiring immediate attention that requires the personal use of their personal cellular telephone, the support staff member shall inform their Building Principal or immediate supervisor before making the call or immediately after using the cellular telephone, depending on the nature of the emergency.
