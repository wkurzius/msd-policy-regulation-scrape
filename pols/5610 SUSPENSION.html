District Policy
5610 - SUSPENSION
Section: Students
Date Created: October 2009
Date Edited: October 2017
The Board of Education recognizes that even the temporary exclusion of a student from the educational program of this district is a severe sanction and one that cannot be imposed without due process.
Any student who is guilty of continued and willful disobedience, or of open defiance of the authority of any teacher or person having authority over him, or of the habitual use of profanity or of obscene language, or who shall cut, deface or otherwise injure any school property, shall be liable to punishment and to suspension or expulsion from school.
Conduct which shall constitute good cause for suspension or expulsion of a student guilty of such conduct shall include, but not be limited to, the conduct as defined in N.J.S.A.
18A:37-2 and the school district’s Student Discipline/Code of Conduct Policy and Regulation in accordance with the N.J.A.C.
6A:16-7.1 et seq.
For the purposes of this Policy, "suspension" means the temporary removal of a student from the regular instructional program.
For the purposes of this Policy, "short term suspension" means a suspension for one, but not more than ten consecutive school days and “long term suspension” means a suspension for more than ten consecutive school days.
In accordance with the provisions of N.J.S.A.
18A:37-4, a student may be suspended only by the Principal, who shall report any suspension to the Superintendent as soon as possible.
The Superintendent shall report the suspension to the Board at its next regular meeting.
The suspended student may be reinstated by the Principal or by the Superintendent prior to the second regular meeting of the Board following the suspension, unless the Board reinstates the student at the first regular meeting.
No student suspended for reasons of assault upon a person in authority may be reinstated before the Board has held a hearing, within thirty calendar days of the suspension, to consider that student’s expulsion from school.
At its second regular meeting after the suspension and thereafter, the Board alone may reinstate the student or continue the suspension.
In accordance with the provisions of N.J.S.A.
18A:37-2a, a student in Kindergarten through grade two shall not receive an out-of-school suspension, except when the suspension is based on conduct that is of a violent or sexual nature that endangers others.
Students in preschool shall not receive an out-of-school suspension except as provided pursuant to the “Zero Tolerance for Guns Act,” N.J.S.A.
18A:37-7 et seq.
The district shall implement an early detection and prevention program to identify students in preschool through grade two who are experiencing behavioral or disciplinary problems and provide behavioral supports for these students which may include, but not be limited to, remediation of problem behaviors, positive reinforcements, supportive interventions, and referral services.
An early detection program may be incorporated into the intervention and referral services required to be established in each school pursuant to State Board of Education regulations.
In each instance of a short-term suspension, the student will be provided oral or written notice of the charges and an informal hearing conducted by the Principal or designee in accordance with the procedures outlined in N.J.A.C.
6A:16-7.2.
To the extent the student’s presence poses a continuing danger to persons or property or an ongoing threat of disrupting the educational process, the student may be immediately removed from the student’s educational program and the informal hearing shall be held as soon as practical after the suspension.
In each instance of a long-term suspension, the district shall assure the rights of the student pursuant to N.J.A.C.
6A:16-7.3.
The district will comply with the requirements of N.J.A.C.
6A:16-7.2 and 7.3, in addition to all the procedural protections set forth in N.J.A.C.

In each instance of a short or long-term suspension, the district shall provide academic instruction, either in school or out of school, that addresses the New Jersey Student Learning Standards pursuant to N.J.A.C.
6A:8-3.1 et seq., which may include a public education program provided in accordance with the provisions of N.J.A.C.
6A:16-9 or 10.
These services shall be provided within five school days of the suspension.
Educational services provided to a student with a disability shall be provided consistent with the student’s Individualized Education Program, in accordance with N.J.A.C.
