A.
Prohibiting Harassment, Intimidation, or Bullying 
The Board of Education prohibits acts of harassment, intimidation, or bullying of a student.
The Board has determined that a safe and civil environment in school is necessary for students to learn and achieve high academic standards; harassment, intimidation, or bullying, like other disruptive or violent behaviors, is conduct that disrupts both a student’s ability to learn and a school’s ability to educate its students in a safe and disciplined environment.
Since students learn by example, school administrators, faculty, staff, and volunteers should be commended for demonstrating appropriate behavior, treating others with civility and respect, and refusing to tolerate harassment, intimidation, or bullying.
For the purposes of this Policy, the term "parent," pursuant to N.J.A.C.
6A:16-1.3, means the natural parent(s); adoptive parent(s); legal guardian(s); resource family parent(s); or parent surrogate(s) of a student.
When parents are separated or divorced, "parent" means the person or agency which has legal custody of the student, as well as the natural or adoptive parent(s) of the student, provided parental rights have not been terminated by a court of appropriate jurisdiction.
B.
Definition of Harassment, Intimidation, or Bullying 
“Harassment, intimidation, or bullying” means any gesture, any written, verbal or physical act, or any electronic communication, as defined in N.J.S.A.
18A:37-14, whether it be a single incident or a series of incidents that:
1.
Is reasonably perceived as being motivated by either any actual or perceived characteristic, such as race, color, religion, ancestry, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, or a mental, physical or sensory disability, or by any other distinguishing characteristic; 
2.
Takes place on school property, at any school-sponsored function, on a school bus, or off school grounds, as provided for in N.J.S.A.
18A:37-15.3;
3.
Substantially disrupts or interferes with the orderly operation of the school or the rights of other students; and that 
a.
A reasonable person should know, under the circumstances, that the act(s) will have the effect of physically or emotionally harming a student or damaging the student’s property, or placing a student in reasonable fear of physical or emotional harm to their person or damage to their property; or
b.
Has the effect of insulting or demeaning any student or group of students; or
c.
Creates a hostile educational environment for the student by interfering with a student’s education or by severely or pervasively causing physical or emotional harm to the student.
The Board recognizes that bullying is unwanted, aggressive behavior that may involve a real or perceived power imbalance.
Recognizing “a real or perceived power imbalance” may assist school officials in identifying harassment, intimidation, or bullying within the context and relative positions of the alleged aggressor and target.
“Electronic communication” means a communication transmitted by means of an electronic device, including, but not limited to, a telephone, cellular phone, computer, or remotely activating paging device (N.J.A.C.
6A:16-1.3).
In accordance with the Board of Education’s Code of Student Conduct and this Policy, all acts of harassment, intimidation, or bullying that occur off school grounds, such as “cyber-bullying” (e.g., the use of electronic means to harass, intimidate, or bully) is addressed in this Policy.
C.
Student Behavior
The Board of Education expects students to conduct themselves in keeping with their levels of development, maturity, and demonstrated capabilities, with a proper regard for the rights and welfare of other students and school staff, the educational purpose underlying all school activities and the care of school facilities and equipment, consistent with the Code of Student Conduct.
The Board believes that standards for student behavior must be set cooperatively through interaction among the parents and other community representatives, school administrators, school employees, school volunteers, and students of the school district, producing an atmosphere that encourages students to grow in self-discipline.
The development of this atmosphere requires respect for self and others, as well as for school district and community property on the part of students, staff, and community members.
Students are expected to behave in a way that creates a supportive learning environment.
The Board believes the best discipline is self-imposed, and that it is the responsibility of staff to use instances of violations of the Code of Student Conduct as opportunities for helping students learn to assume and accept responsibility for their behavior and the consequences of their behavior.
Staff members who interact with students shall apply best practices designed to prevent student conduct problems and foster students’ abilities to grow in self-discipline.
The Board expects students will act in accordance with the student behavioral expectations and standards regarding harassment, intimidation, or bullying, including:
1.
Student responsibilities (e.g., requirements for students to conform to reasonable standards of socially accepted behavior; respect the person, property, and rights of others; obey constituted authority; and respond to those who hold that authority); 
2.
Appropriate recognition for positive reinforcement for good conduct, self-discipline, and good citizenship;
3.
Student rights; and
4.
Sanctions and due process for violations of the Code of Student Conduct.
Pursuant to N.J.S.A.
18A:37-15(a) and N.J.A.C.
6A:16-7.1(a)1, the district has involved a broad-base of school and community members, including parents, school employees, volunteers, students, and community representatives, in the development of this Policy.
Pursuant to N.J.A.C.
6A:16-7.1, the Board developed guidelines for student conduct, taking into consideration the nature of the behavior; the nature of the student’s disability, if any and to the extent relevant; the developmental ages of students; severity of the offenses and students’ histories of inappropriate behaviors; and the mission and physical facilities of the individual school(s) in the district.
This Policy requires all students in the district to adhere to the rules established by the school district and to submit to the remedial and consequential measures that are appropriately assigned for infractions of these rules.
Pursuant to N.J.A.C.
6A:16-7.1, the Superintendent shall annually provide to students and their parents the rules of the district regarding student conduct.
Provisions shall be made for informing parents whose primary language is other than English.
The district prohibits active or passive support for acts of harassment, intimidation, or bullying.
The school district will support students who: 
1.
Walk away from acts of harassment, intimidation, or bullying when they see them; 
2.
Constructively attempt to stop acts of harassment, intimidation, or bullying; 
3.
Provide support to students who have been subjected to harassment, intimidation, or bullying; and 
4.
Report acts of harassment, intimidation, or bullying to the designated school staff member.
D.
Consequences and Remedial Actions
The Board of Education requires its school administrators to implement procedures that ensure both the appropriate consequences and remedial responses for students who commit one or more acts of harassment, intimidation, or bullying, consistent with the Code of Student Conduct, and the consequences and remedial responses for staff members who commit one or more acts of harassment, intimidation, or bullying.
In every incident found to be harassment, intimidation, or bullying, the school Principal, in consultation with appropriate school staff, may apply disciplinary consequences and/or remedial actions, such as the provision of counseling, behavioral interventions, or other measures.
Appropriate consequences and remedial actions are those that are graded according to the severity of the offenses; consider the developmental ages of the student offenders; the nature of the student’s disability, if any and to the extent relevant; and students’ histories of inappropriate behaviors, per the Code of Student Conduct and N.J.A.C.

E.
Reporting Harassment, Intimidation, or Bullying 
The Board of Education requires the Principal at each school to be responsible for receiving all complaints alleging harassment, intimidation, or bullying committed by an adult or youth against a student.
All Board members, school employees, and volunteers and contracted service providers who have contact with students, are required to verbally report alleged acts of harassment, intimidation, or bullying to the Principal or designee on the same day when the individual witnessed or received reliable information regarding any such incident.
All Board members, school employees, and contracted service providers who have contact with students, also shall submit a New Jersey Department of Education-approved HIB 338 Form to the Principal within two school days of the verbal report.
Failure to make the required report(s) may result in disciplinary action.
The HIB 338 Form shall be kept on file at the school, but shall not be included in any student record unless the incident results in disciplinary action or is otherwise required to be contained in a student’s record under State or Federal Law.
The district may not fail to initiate an investigation of harassment, intimidation, or bullying solely because written documentation was not provided.
Failing to conduct a harassment, intimidation, or bullying investigation solely because a parent or student did not submit written documentation violates the Anti-Bullying Bill of Rights Act and this Policy.
If a parent makes a verbal allegation of harassment, intimidation, or bullying to a district staff member, but does not complete and submit the HIB 338 Form, the staff member or a designee must complete and submit the HIB 338 Form.
The Principal or designee is required to inform the parents of all students involved in alleged incidents, and, as appropriate, may discuss the availability of counseling and other intervention services.
Pursuant to N.J.A.C.
6A:16-7.7(a)2.viii.(2), when providing notification to the parents of all students involved, the Principal or designee shall take into account the circumstances of the incident when conveying the nature of the incident, including the actual or perceived category motivating the alleged offense.
The Principal or designee shall keep a written record of the date, time, and manner of notification to the parents.
The Principal, upon receiving a verbal or written report, may take interim measures to ensure the safety, health, and welfare of all parties pending the findings of the investigation.
Students, parents, and visitors are encouraged to report alleged acts of harassment, intimidation, or bullying to the Principal or designee on the same day when the individual witnessed or received reliable information regarding any such incident.
The school district shall provide a person an online means to complete the HIB 338 Form to anonymously report an act of harassment, intimidation, or bullying.
Formal action for violations of the Code of Student Conduct may not be taken solely on the basis of an anonymous report.
A Board member or school employee who promptly reports an incident of harassment, intimidation, or bullying and who makes this report in compliance with the procedures set forth in this Policy, is immune from a cause of action for damages arising from any failure to remedy the reported incident.
The Principal shall promptly submit a copy of each completed HIB 338 Form to the Superintendent.
The district may consider every mechanism available to simplify reporting, including standard reporting forms and/or web-based reporting mechanisms.
For anonymous reporting, in addition to making the HIB 338 Form available online, the district may consider locked boxes located in areas of a school where reports can be submitted without fear of being observed.
A school administrator who receives a report of harassment, intimidation, or bullying or who determines a reported incident or complaint, assuming all facts presented are true, is a report within the scope of N.J.S.A.
18A:37-14 and fails to initiate or conduct an investigation, or who should have known of an incident of harassment, intimidation, or bullying and fails to take sufficient action to minimize or eliminate the harassment, intimidation, or bullying, may be subject to disciplinary action.
The district also should consider procedures and disciplinary action when it is found that someone had information regarding a harassment, intimidation, or bullying incident, but did not make the required report(s).

Investigating Allegations of Harassment, Intimidation, or Bullying 
Investigate All Reports 
The Board of Education requires a thorough and complete investigation to be conducted for each report of an alleged incident of harassment, intimidation, or bullying.
All details of an alleged incident must be populated into the HIB 338 Form.
However, completing the form shall not delay beginning the investigation in accordance with the law.
The HIB 338 Form shall be kept on file at the school and will only be added to a student record if the alleged incident is founded, disciplinary action is imposed or is otherwise required to be contained in a student’s record under State or Federal law.
The investigation shall be initiated by the Principal or designee within one school day of the verbal report of the incident.
The investigation shall be conducted by the school anti-bullying specialist appointed by the Principal.
The Principal may appoint additional personnel who are not school anti-bullying specialists to assist the school anti-bullying specialist in the investigation.
Investigations of complaints concerning adult conduct shall not be investigated by a member of the same bargaining unit as the individual who is the subject of the investigation.
The anti-bullying specialist may not participate in an investigation regarding their supervisor or staff at a higher administrative level.
The investigation shall be completed, and the written findings submitted to the Principal as soon as possible, but not later than ten school days from the date of the written report of the alleged incident of harassment, intimidation, or bullying or from the date of the written notification from the Superintendent to the Principal to initiate an investigation.
Should information regarding the reported incident and the investigation be received after the end of the ten-day period, the school anti-bullying specialist or the Principal shall amend the original report of the results of the investigation to ensure there is an accurate and current record of the facts and activities concerning the reported incident.
The Principal shall proceed in accordance with the Code of Student Conduct, as appropriate, based on the investigation findings.
The Principal shall submit the report to the Superintendent within two school days of the completion of the investigation and in accordance with the Administrative Procedures Act (N.J.S.A.
52:14B-1 et seq.).
As appropriate to the findings from the investigation, the Superintendent shall ensure the Code of Student Conduct has been implemented and provide intervention services; order counseling; establish training programs to reduce harassment, intimidation, or bullying and enhance school climate; or take or recommend other appropriate action, including seeking further information as necessary.
The Superintendent shall report the results of each investigation to the Board no later than the date of the regularly scheduled Board meeting following the completion of the investigation.
The Superintendent’s report also shall include information on any consequences imposed under the Code of Student Conduct; intervention services provided; counseling ordered; training established; or other action taken or recommended by the Superintendent.
Parents of students who are parties to the investigation shall be provided with information about the investigation, in accordance with Federal and State law and regulation.
The information to be provided to parents includes the nature of the investigation, whether the district found evidence of harassment, intimidation, or bullying, or whether consequences were imposed or services provided to address the incident of harassment, intimidation, or bullying.
This information shall be provided in writing within five school days after the results of the investigation are reported to the Board.
The district may not divulge personally identifying information or any information that could result in the identification of any student other than the child of the parents being notified.
A parent or may request a hearing before the Board after receiving the information.
Any request by the parents for a hearing before the Board concerning the written information about a harassment, intimidation, or bullying investigation, pursuant to N.J.S.A.

The Board also requires the thorough investigation of complaints or reports of harassment, intimidation, or bullying, occurring on district school buses, at district school-sponsored functions, and off school grounds involving a student who attends an approved private school for students with disabilities.
The investigation will be conducted by the Board’s anti-bullying specialist in consultation with the approved private school for students with disabilities.
H.
Responding to Harassment, Intimidation, or Bullying 
The Board of Education authorizes the Principal of each school to define the range of ways in which school staff will respond once an incident of harassment, intimidation, or bullying is confirmed, and the Superintendent shall respond to confirmed harassment, intimidation, or bullying, according to the parameters described below and in this Policy.
The Board recognizes that some acts of harassment, intimidation, or bullying may be isolated incidents requiring that the school officials respond appropriately to the individual(s) committing the acts.
Other acts may be so serious or parts of a larger pattern of harassment, intimidation, or bullying that they require a response either at the classroom, school building, or school district levels or by law enforcement officials.
Consequences and appropriate remedial actions for a student who commits an act of harassment, intimidation, or bullying may range from positive behavioral interventions up to and including suspension or expulsion, as permitted under N.J.S.A.
18A:37, Discipline of Pupils and as set forth in N.J.A.C.
6A:16-7.2, Short-term suspensions, N.J.A.C.
6A:16-7.3, Long-term suspensions, and N.J.A.C.
6A:16-7.4, Expulsions.
In considering whether a response beyond the individual is appropriate, school officials shall consider the nature and circumstances of the act; the degree of harm; the nature and severity of the behavior; past incidences or past or continuing patterns of behavior; and the context in which the alleged incident(s) occurred.
Institutional (i.e., classroom, school building, school district) responses can range from school and community surveys, to mailings, to focus groups, to adoption of research-based harassment, intimidation, or bullying prevention program models, to training for certificated and non-certificated staff, to participation of parents and other community members and organizations, to small or large group presentations for fully addressing the actions and the school’s response to the actions, in the context of the acceptable student and staff member behavior and the consequences of such actions, and to the involvement of law enforcement officers, including safe schools resource officers.
This Policy and the Code of Student Conduct shall apply to instances when a school employee is made aware of alleged harassment, intimidation, or bullying occurring off school grounds.
For every incident of harassment, intimidation, or bullying, the school officials must respond appropriately to the individual who committed the act.
The range of responses to confirmed harassment, intimidation, or bullying acts should include individual, classroom, school, or district responses, as appropriate to the findings from each incident.
Examples of responses that apply to each of these categories are provided below: 
1.
Individual responses can include positive behavioral interventions (e.g., peer mentoring, short-term counseling, life skills groups) and punitive actions (e.g., detention, in-school or out-of-school suspension, expulsion, law enforcement report or other legal action).
2.
Classroom responses can include class discussions about an incident of harassment, intimidation, or bullying, role plays, research projects, observing and discussing audio-visual materials on these subjects, and skill-building lessons in courtesy, tolerance, assertiveness, and conflict management.
3.
School responses can include theme days, learning station programs, parent programs, and information disseminated to students and parents, such as fact sheets or newsletters explaining acceptable uses of electronic and wireless communication devices or strategies for fostering expected student behavior.
4.
District-wide responses can include community involvement in policy review and development; professional development programs; adoption of curricular and school-wide programs, coordination with community-based organizations (e.g., mental health, health services, health facilities, law enforcement officials, faith-based organizations); and disseminating information on the core ethical values adopted by the Board’s Code of Student Conduct, per N.J.A.C.
6A:16-7.1(a)2.
In providing support for victims of harassment, intimidation, or bullying, the district should identify a range of strategies and resources, which may include, but is not limited to, the following actions for individual victims: 
•   Counseling;
•   Teacher Aides;
•   Hallway and playground monitors;
•   Schedule changes;
•   Before and after school supervision;
•   School transportation supervision;
