0168 - RECORDING BOARD MEETINGS
Section: Bylaws
Date Created: October 2009
Date Edited: October 2009
The Board of Education directs the creation and maintenance of an official record of the formal proceedings of the Board and will permit the unofficial recording of Board meetings in accordance with this bylaw.
Minutes
The Board shall keep reasonably comprehensible minutes of all its meetings showing the time and place, the members present, the subject considered, the actions taken, the vote of each member, information sufficient to explain the actions taken, and any other information required to be shown in the minutes by law.
Minutes of public meetings shall be public records signed by the Board Secretary and filed in the Secretary's office in a minute book as the permanent record of the acts of this Board.
Minutes of executive meetings shall be filed in the Secretary's office in a place separate from the minute book until the time, if any, when the proceedings may be made public.
At that time, the minutes shall be public records and shall be filed in the regular minute book.
The Secretary shall provide each Board member with a copy of the minutes no later than two days before the next regular Board meeting.
Recording by the Public
Any member of the public may record the proceedings of a public meeting of the Board in a manner that does not interrupt the proceedings, inhibit the conduct of the meeting, or distract Board members or other observers present at the meeting.
The Board will permit the use of audio tape recorder(s), still or movie camera(s), or videotape camera(s) only when notice of such intended use has been given to the Board Secretary three days in advance of the meeting.
No more than five cameras may be in use at any time, and any camera must be operated in an inconspicuous location in the meeting room.
The presiding officer shall determine when any recording device interferes with the conduct of a Board meeting and may order that an interfering device be removed.
Any recording of a Board meeting that is made available to persons other than the maker of the recording and is set forth as a true and accurate record of that meeting must be open to inspection by the Board and may be copied by this Board at the Board's expense.
