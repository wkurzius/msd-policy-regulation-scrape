5332 - DO NOT RESUSCITATE ORDERS (M)
Section: Students
Date Created: October 2009
Date Edited: October 2009
M
Federal and State legislation entitles every pupil to a free, appropriate public education in the least restrictive environment.
Due to the high risk of medically fragile pupils and pupils with chronic illnesses, who in the past would not have survived to be able to attend school, families, professionals, and school personnel are challenged with new issues in caring for these pupils in the school setting.
Some families may wish not to pursue life-saving medical protocols for their child due to the lack of benefit to the pupil’s condition or quality of life that is likely to result from following these protocols.
In accordance with N.J.A.C.
6A:16-2.1(a)3, all Do Not Resuscitate (DNR) orders received for a pupil will be thoroughly and carefully reviewed.
“Do Not Resuscitate order” or “DNR order” means a written directive signed by the parent or legal guardian of a pupil who, after consultation with the pupil’s pediatrician and other advisors, declines emergency administration of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and automatic external defibrillator (AED) to the pupil.
“Written order” means a directive and protocol written by the pupil’s medical home to address a healthcare need or provide a medical service for a specific pupil.
“Medical home” means a health care provider and that provider’s practice site chosen by the pupil’s parent or legal guardian for the provision of health care.
A family desiring to pursue a DNR order must submit a written order, which should be developed after a meeting with the parent(s) or legal guardian(s), the pupil, if appropriate, the school physician, the school nurse, the pupil’s family healthcare provider, and the local emergency medical services provider.
The written order shall include specific written emergency orders and shall specifically meet the goals for the pupil.
Community emergency medical services protocols must be clearly defined in the written order.
The school nurse is responsible for providing an appropriate response to DNR orders.
The school nurse will coordinate the school district’s review of the written order with the Building Principal or designee, the school physician, and the Superintendent of Schools or designee.
The Superintendent of Schools or designee will review the written order with the Board of Education and the school Board Attorney.
The school physician shall be responsible for instructing school staff in DNR orders.
The existence of a DNR written order and plan shall be referenced on the pupil’s health form that is approved for use by the Commissioner of Education.
A copy of the DNR written order shall be placed with the pupil’s individualized health record and a copy should be kept with the local emergency medical services provider.
The DNR written order shall be reviewed whenever a change occurs in the pupil’s condition and at least once every six months.
