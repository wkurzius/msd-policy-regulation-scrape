Section: Program
Date Created: October 2009
Date Edited: May 2011
The Board of Education acknowledges the educational validity of work assigned to pupils for completion outside the classroom as an adjunct to and extension of the instructional program of
the schools.
The Superintendent shall develop regulations for the assignment of homework according to these guidelines:
1.
Homework should be a properly planned part of the curriculum, extending and reinforcing the learning experience of the school;
2.
Homework should help children learn by providing practice in the mastery of skills, experience in data gathering and integration of knowledge, and an opportunity to remediate learning problems;
3.
Homework should help develop the pupil's responsibility and provide an opportunity for the exercise of independent work and judgment;
4.
The number, frequency, and degree of difficulty of homework assignments should be based on the ability and needs of the pupil and take into account other activities that make a legitimate claim on the pupil's time;
5.
As a valid educational tool, homework should be clearly assigned and its product carefully evaluated and that evaluation should be reported to the pupil;
6.
Homework may be assigned during vacations and 
summer break.
If assigned summer homework will count as a
test grade.
7.
The schools should recognize the role of parent(s) or legal guardian(s) by suggesting ways in which parent(s) or legal guardian(s) may assist the school in helping a child carry out assigned responsibilities;    
8.
Homework should always serve a valid learning purpose; it should never be used  as a punitive measure.
