District Policy
2340 - FIELD TRIPS
Section: Program
Date Created: October 2009
Date Edited: October 2009
The Board of Education recognizes that field trips, properly planned and integrated with the curriculum, are an educationally sound and important part of the program of the schools and can supplement and enrich classroom instruction by providing learning experiences in an environment outside the school.
Trips that are solely recreational in nature shall not be sponsored or permitted by the school district.
For purposes of this policy, a field trip shall be defined as a journey by a group of pupils away from the school premises and under the supervision of a teacher.
The Superintendent shall approve all field trips, except that the Board shall approve field trips designed to remove pupils from the district overnight or longer and those involving travel by air or train.
For overnight senior class trips, the Board of Education will be given relevant information in a timely fashion and it shall be the responsibility of the senior class adviser to provide this information to the Superintendent and the Board.
The Board may authorize field trips for which all or part of the costs are borne by the pupil's parent(s) or legal guardian(s), except that no pupil in a special education class or pupil unable to pay the costs assessed shall be prohibited from attending a field trip.
Pupils on field trips remain under the supervision of this Board and are subject to its rules and regulations.
The Board does not endorse, support, or assume liability in any way for any staff member of this district who takes pupils on trips not approved by the Board or Superintendent.
No staff member may solicit pupils of this district without Board or Superintendent approval.
The Superintendent shall prepare regulations for the operation of a field trip which shall insure that the safety and well-being of pupils shall be protected at all times; parent(s) or legal guardian(s) permission is sought and obtained before any pupil may be removed from the district for a field trip; each field trip is properly planned, integrated with the curriculum, and followed up by appropriate activities which enhance its usefulness; and that no pupil, including those eligible for free and reduced rate meals under the school lunch program, is denied participation for lack of funds.
