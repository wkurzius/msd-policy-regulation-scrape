9230 - PARENTAL RESPONSIBILITIES
Section: Community
Date Created: October 2009
Date Edited: October 2009
The Board of Education believes that children benefit when parent(s) or legal guardian(s) recognize and discharge a responsibility to encourage and support the learning process.
Parent(s) or legal guardian(s) can help children learn by:
1.
Requiring that children obey all school rules and by accepting responsibility for a child's improper conduct;
2.
Sending children to school with proper attention to health, personal cleanliness, and dress;
3.
Maintaining an active interest in each child's daily work and making it possible for the child to complete assigned homework by providing a quiet place and suitable conditions for study;
4.
Reading communications from the school and signing and returning them promptly when so requested;
5.
Attending conferences arranged for the exchange of information on the child's progress in school; and
6.
Scheduling family matters to minimize interference with school time.
Adopted:  20 October 2009
