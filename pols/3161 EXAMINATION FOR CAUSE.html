6A:32-6.3(b).
The Superintendent shall require a physical and/or psychiatric examination on a teaching staff member whenever, in the judgment of the Superintendent, a teaching staff member shows evidence of deviation from normal physical or mental health, to determine the teaching staff member’s physical and mental fitness to perform with reasonable accommodation the position the teaching staff member currently holds, or to detect any health risks to students and other employees.
A teaching staff member that is required to undergo a physical and/or psychiatric examination shall be provided a written statement of reasons for the required examination(s) and notice the teaching staff member has the right to request a hearing with the Board.
The hearing shall be conducted in accordance with the provisions of N.J.S.A.
18A:25-7 and will offer the teaching staff member the opportunity to appear before the Board to refute the reasons for the required examination(s), provided any such hearing is requested by the teaching staff member in writing within five working days of the teaching staff member’s receipt of the written statement of reasons.
A teaching staff member shall be ordered to submit to the appropriate examination(s) by the physician or institution designated by the Board if the teaching staff member failed to timely request a hearing before the Board or failed to persuade the Board at the hearing that the teaching staff member should not be required to submit to the appropriate examination(s).
The Board’s determination at the conclusion of such a hearing is appealable to the Commissioner of Education pursuant to N.J.S.A.

The Board shall require the teaching staff member to authorize the release of the examination results to the Superintendent.
If the results of any such examination indicate mental abnormality or communicable disease, the teaching staff member shall be ineligible for further service until proof of recovery, satisfactory to the Board, is furnished, but if the teaching staff member is under contract or has tenure, they may be granted sick leave with compensation as provided by law and shall, upon satisfactory recovery, be permitted to complete the term of their contract, if they are under contract, or be reemployed with the same tenure as they possessed at the time their services were discontinued, if they have tenure, unless their absence shall exceed a period of two years in accordance with N.J.S.A.
