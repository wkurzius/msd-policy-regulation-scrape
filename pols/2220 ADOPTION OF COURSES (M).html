Section: Program
Date Created: October 2009
Date Edited: October 2009
M
The Board of Education shall provide a comprehensive instructional program to serve the educational needs of the children of this district by the adoption of courses of study.
For purposes of this policy, a “course of study” means the planned content of a series of classes, courses, subjects, studies, or related activities.
No course of study will be taught in this district unless it has been formally adopted by the Board.
The Board shall determine which units of the instructional program constitute courses of study and are thereby subject to the adoption procedures of the Board.
Each course of study approved for credit toward high school graduation shall include minimum course proficiencies.
In order to satisfactorily complete a course of study, a pupil must demonstrate mastery of the established minimum level of course proficiencies.
Core course proficiencies shall include, but need not be limited to, proficiencies established by the State Board of Education in the curriculum areas of mathematics; natural or physical sciences; English; social studies; foreign languages; fine, practical, and performing arts; career education; and health, safety, and physical education.
The Superintendent is responsible for the continuous evaluation of the courses of study against the educational goals of the Board and shall recommend to the Board such new or altered courses of study as are deemed to be in the best interests of the pupils of this district.
The Superintendent's recommendation will include the following information about the proposed course of study:
1.
The specific objective of the course of study and the relationship of the course to the educational goals adopted by the Board;
2.
The applicability of the course to pupils and an enumeration of those groups of pupils to be affected by it;
3.
A description of course content, including any instructional method that departs significantly from the ordinary and is an integral part of the course of study;
4.
A rationale for the course in terms of the goals of this district and a justification of the course, especially when it is proposed to take the place of an existing course of study;
5.
The resources that implementation of the course will require, including textbooks, material, equipment, and specially trained personnel;
6.
The course proficiencies to be mastered by pupils;
7.
The methods and standards by which the efficacy of the course will be monitored and evaluated; and
8.
A developmental history of the course and, where available, information on its use elsewhere.
The Superintendent shall maintain a current list of all courses of study offered by this district and shall provide each member of the Board with a copy.
