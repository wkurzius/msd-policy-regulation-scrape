The Board of Education recognizes that teaching staff members will have expertise and knowledge in areas that other school districts, agencies, and other entities may desire.
Recognizing that the school district will request the expertise from teaching staff members from other school districts, agencies and other entities, the Board supports sharing of its teaching staff members with other school districts, agencies, and other entities to the extent it does not interfere with the efficient operation of the school district.
The Superintendent may recommend to the Board a teaching staff memberâ€™s attendance in another school district, agency or other entity without additional remuneration to the teaching staff member or school district, upon a written request from the agency or from the teaching staff member.
The Board of Education recognizes teaching staff members will have expertise and knowledge in areas that other school districts, public and private agencies, and private business organizations may desire to compensate as a paid consultant.
