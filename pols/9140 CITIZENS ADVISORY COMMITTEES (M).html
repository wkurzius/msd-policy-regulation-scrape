Section: Community
Date Created: October 2009
Date Edited: July 2023
M
The Board of Education encourages communication between the school district and the community at large.
Citizens advisory committees may be useful in keeping the Board and the administration informed with regard to community opinion and in representing the community.
The Board may establish a citizens advisory committee to provide input to the Board and the administration from the community for funded programs as the law requires and as the Board sees fit.
In creating a new citizens advisory committee, the Board may appoint: members of the community who are able and interested in the subject and concerned about the schools; members who represent a wide range of community interests and backgrounds; a chairperson; one or more Board members; and school staff members.
The Board President or designee and the Superintendent or designee shall serve as members of the citizens advisory committee.
In charging a new citizens advisory committee, the Board shall define the citizens advisory committee assignment in writing, set a date for report(s) to the Board, and establish a budget, if needed.
Expenditures of district funds by a citizens advisory committee shall be made upon the approval of the Superintendent.
Recommendations of citizens advisory committee shall not reduce the responsibility of the Board, which may accept, reject, or modify a citizens advisory committeeâ€™s recommendation(s) in the exercise of its statutory discretion.
Meetings of citizens advisory committee that are attended by fewer than a majority of the members of the Board are not subject to the Open Public Meetings Act and need not be open to the public, except as expressly permitted by the Board.
