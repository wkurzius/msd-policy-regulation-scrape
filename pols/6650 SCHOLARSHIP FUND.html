Section: Finances
Date Created: October 2009
Date Edited: October 2009
The school district periodically receives contributions from organizations or individuals intended for scholarship awards to worthy graduates or former pupils or the establishment of a scholarship fund.
Accordingly, the Board of Education establishes the following policy and procedures for their disposition.
General Guidelines Concerning Scholarships and Scholarship Funds
1.
School Principals are authorized to accept and acknowledge contributions of less than $1,000.00 intended as one-time grants to pupils or former pupils.
Any contribution of more than $1,000.00 or money contributed to establish a permanent scholarship fund must be officially accepted by the Board of Education.
2.
Contributors will be encouraged to specify in some detail their intentions for the use of contributed funds.
3.
Anyone contributing $1,000.00 or less will be encouraged to make a one time grant to (a) pupil(s).
4.
Anyone contributing $1,001.00 to $5,000.00 will be encouraged to establish a plan that exhausts the funds within five years.
Insofar as possible and as permitted by funds available, minimum scholarship awards should be $500.00.
5.
Scholarship recipients will be identified by a committee of teachers, administrators, and interested parent(s) or legal guardian(s) and/or community members convened by the Principal or his/her designee.
6.
The committee will report its determinations and the rationale for them to the Superintendent, who will review the recommendations and approve them or ask the committee to reconsider.
Accounting for Scholarships and Scholarship Funds
1.
The Board of Education will maintain a single interest-bearing bank account, deposit all scholarship donations into it, and disburse all scholarship awards from it.
2.
The School Business Administrator/Board Secretary or another person designated to manage this account will maintain separate records of receipts and disbursements for any permanent fund accepted by the Board.
Interest earned by the account will be allocated to individual funds in the proportion their principal bears to the entire principal.
3.
The account manager is authorized to move the fund to a higher paying position but any investment must be in a bank approved as a Board depository, in an insured investment vehicle approved by the State Department of Education, and for a period not extending past May 31 of the next year.
4.
Scholarship award checks will be prepared at the direction of the Superintendent.
