5700 - PUPIL RIGHTS
Section: Students
Date Created: October 2009
Date Edited: October 2009
The Board of Education recognizes that pupils possess both the right to a free public education and the rights of citizenship.
In granting pupils the educational opportunities to which they are entitled, the Board shall provide them with the nurture, counsel, and custodial care appropriate to pupils' ages and maturity.
At the same time, the Board will respect the right of each pupil to equal treatment and equal access to the educational program, the due process of law, freedom of expression and association, and the privacy of his/her own thoughts.
Attendant on the rights guaranteed to each pupil are certain responsibilities, which include respect for the rights of others, obedience to properly constituted school authority, and compliance with the policies and regulations of this district.
As pupils differ in age and maturity, so they differ in the ability to assume both the rights and the concomitant responsibilities of citizenship.
Accordingly, the exercise of each right will be granted with due regard for the degree of responsibility possessed by the pupil and the pupil's need for continuing guidance and control.
A pupil who has reached the age of majority and is emancipated, possesses the full rights of an adult and may issue authorizations previously delegated to his/her parent(s) or legal guardian(s).
The adult pupil is fully responsible for his/her educational performance, attendance, compliance with district regulations, and care of school property.
The parent(s) or legal guardian(s) of each adult pupil will be informed of the rights of the pupil and will continue to be informed of the pupil's progress in school.
