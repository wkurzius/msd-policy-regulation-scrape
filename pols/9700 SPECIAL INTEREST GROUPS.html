The Board of Education recognizes the contributions of persons and organizations outside the school district may take the form of materials, activities, and awards that tend to serve the interests of the contributor as well as benefit the school district and pupils.
For the purposes of this Policy, “organizations outside the school district” shall be any organization, group, activity, club, association, agency, or individual that is not approved or sponsored by the Board of Education.
The Board reserves the right to review, approve, or reject proposed contributions from organizations outside the school district.
Proposed contributions may be rejected by the Board, including but not limited to, proposed contributions that have the primary effect of advancing the name, product, or special interest of a person, corporation, or organization; fail to meet district standards of accuracy and good taste; are of little or no educational value to pupils; make unreasonable demands upon the time and energies of staff and pupils or upon the resources of the district; interrupt or interfere with the regular school program; or involve a direct cost to the district.
The approval of the use of any material or the conduct of any activity offered by an organization outside the school district shall not under any circumstances be construed as an endorsement by this Board of any interest, cause, or organization.
Permission to solicit or raise funds on school premises will be granted only to those persons and organizations whose purposes are consistent with the goals of this district and the interests of the community and are in accordance with the Board’s fundraising policy.
Solicitation or fundraising may not interfere with the orderly operation of the schools.
The Board will not be responsible for the protection of or accounting for such funds and these funds may not be deposited in any district account.
The Board will not permit the distribution of literature to or through pupils in the school district for any organization outside the school district.
However, distribution of literature to or through pupils in the school district     may be approved by the Superintendent of Schools or designee if the organization requesting the distribution of literature is a local, State, county or                     Federal governmental agency or a community, non-profit organization and the 
information is determined by the Superintendent or designee to be of special
interest to school district pupils or the community.
Written requests for the distribution of this literature must be submitted to the Superintendent or designee with one copy of the specific literature to be distributed.
The approval and method of the distribution of literature will be at the discretion of the Superintendent or designee.
Any approval for such distribution will be consistent with the governing principles of the First Amendment of the United States Constitution.
In no circumstance will the school district release confidential pupil information.
The Board prohibits the distribution of political literature to or through the pupils of this district in school buildings or on school grounds that promotes, favors, or opposes the candidacy of any candidate for election at any annual school election, or the adoption of any bond issue, proposal, or any public question submitted at any general, municipal or school election.
No pupil shall be requested or directed by any school official or employee to engage in any activity that tends to promote, favor, or oppose any such candidacy, bond issue, proposal or a public question submitted at any election.
The Board will permit the award of scholarships or prizes to deserving pupils provided that information regarding pupils is released only in accordance with Policy No.
