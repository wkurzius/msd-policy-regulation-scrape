In accordance with the provisions of N.J.A.C.

The district shall include in the Comprehensive Annual Financial Report (CAFR) a detailed organizational chart for the Central office that tie to the district’s position control logs, including but not limited to, the business, human resources, and information management functions.

Districts required to maintain an ERP System that do not have an ERP System in place on July 1, 2008 shall fully implement an ERP System by the 2010-2011 school year and maintain both the existing system(s) and run a beta test ERP System during the 2009-2010 school year.
Whenever considering financial systems or the automation of other services or functions, the Superintendent of Schools or School Business Administrator/Board Secretary shall notify the Executive County Superintendent in writing to see if opportunities for a shared service system exist.
Access controls shall be established for key elements of financial systems to ensure that a single person does not have the ability to make system edits that would violate segregation of duties controls.

Districts are required to maintain a position control roster by December 31, 2009.
