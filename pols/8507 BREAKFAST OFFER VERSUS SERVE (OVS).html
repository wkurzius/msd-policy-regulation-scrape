District Policy
8507 - BREAKFAST OFFER VERSUS SERVE  (OVS)
Section: Operations
Date Created: November 2014
Date Edited: November 2014
The Board of Education, to be in compliance with the Healthy Hunger Free Kids Act (HHFKA) of 2010, adopts this Offer Versus Serve (OVS) Policy.
Offer Versus Serve is a Policy for Federally reimbursable meals that allows students to decline a certain number of food components in the meal to reduce plate waste and food cost.
Board of Education approval to implement a Breakfast OVS Policy is optional at all grade levels.
The provisions of the Breakfast OVS Policy shall be in accordance with the requirements of the HHFKA of 2010.
A school breakfast eligible for Federal reimbursement shall offer four food items from the three food components in the appropriate amounts per grade grouping:
•   Fruit or vegetable or juice;
•   Milk; and
• Grains (including optional meat/meat alternate).
Students are allowed to decline one of the four food items offered.
A student's decision to accept all four food items or to decline one food item shall not affect the price charged for the meal as the breakfast is priced as a unit.
If students do not choose enough food items to comprise a reimbursable meal, a la carte prices will be charged.
School staff members cannot make exceptions to the Policy, such as requiring every student to take a particular food component.
It is the student's choice to select any three or all four food items of the reimbursable meal.
At each school implementing this OVS Policy, school food service staff members will be trained annually on the provisions of the district’s Breakfast OVS Policy.
Breakfast OVS will be implemented in all schools in the district.
Adopted:    18 November 2014
