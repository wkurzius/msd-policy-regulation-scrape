6112 - REIMBURSEMENT OF FEDERAL AND OTHER GRANT EXPENDITURES
Section: Finances
Date Created: August 2012
Date Edited: July 2023
M
The Cash Management Improvement Act (CMIA) and related Federal regulations require a State to minimize the time elapsing between the transfer of funds from the United States Treasury and the expenditure of funds for program purposes.
This requirement applies to grantees such as the State of New Jersey and their subgrantees, such as a school district.
The State of New Jersey and school districts must assure funds have been, or will be, spent within a minimal amount of time after having been drawn from the Federal government.
In accordance with this requirement, the New Jersey Department of Education (NJDOE) has implemented a reimbursement request system of payment.
The procedures as outlined in the New Jersey Department of Education Policies and Procedures for Reimbursement of Federal and Other Grant Expenditures shall be followed by school districts in submitting reimbursement requests.
Reimbursement requests for entitlement grant awards under the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), the Strengthening Career and Technical Education for the 21st Century Act, and any other program designated by the NJDOE shall be made using the NJDOE’s Electronic Web-Enabled Grant (EWEG) System.
Reimbursement requests by the School Business Administrator/Board Secretary or designee shall be made for individual titles and awards using the payment functionality of the EWEG system.
Only one reimbursement request per month may be submitted for an individual title, award, or subgrant.
Reimbursement requests may only be for expenditures that have already occurred or will occur within three business days of receipt of funds.
The submission of a reimbursement request constitutes a certification by the School Business Administrator/Board Secretary that the school district has previously made the appropriate expenditures and/or will make the expenditures within three business days of receipt of funds and that the expenditures are allowable and appropriate to the cost objective(s) of the subgrant.
The Superintendent or designee is responsible for submitting an amendment application to the NJDOE for approval if a new budget category for which no funds were previously budgeted or approved has been created.
The Superintendent or designee is responsible for submitting an amendment application to the NJDOE for approval if cumulative transfers among expenditure categories exceed ten percent of the total award.
The Superintendent or designee is responsible for monitoring the cumulative ten percent level of fiscal change.
Reimbursement requests must be in accordance with approved grant applications.
A reimbursement request may be submitted at any time after the subgrant has received final NJDOE approval.
Reimbursement requests submitted at least ten business days before the end of the month but no later than the fifteenth day of the month will be reviewed and, if approved, processed for payment the first business day of the following month.
School districts will normally receive payment by the fifth business day of the month and will be able to track the grant’s payment history in EWEG through the payments link of the grant application.
Reimbursement requests must contain a brief description of the expenditures for which reimbursement is being requested.
Individual line items need not be detailed.
Expenditures must be supported by documentation at the school district level but should not be submitted to the NJDOE with a reimbursement request.
The Superintendent or designee is responsible to maintain supporting documentation for seven years and for making it available to the NJDOE, the United States Department of Education, and/or their authorized representatives upon request.
Documentation for salary expenditures is subject to the requirements of the Federal Uniform Grant Guidance.
Documentation for all other expenditures must include evidence that the expenditures are allowable costs and of the relationship of the expenditure to the subgrant’s cost objectives.
The NJDOE staff will review reimbursement requests to determine that they meet the subgrant’s criteria.
When a reimbursement request is approved or denied, the school district will receive an email notification through the EWEG system.
Approval of a reimbursement request by NJDOE does not imply approval of the expenditures as allowable or appropriate to the subgrant’s cost objectives as the approval of expenditures will continue to be processed through the final report.
The School Business Administrator/Board Secretary or designee assumes responsibility for assuring that all funds requested through the EWEG system either have already been expended, or will be expended within three business days of receipt of funds.
