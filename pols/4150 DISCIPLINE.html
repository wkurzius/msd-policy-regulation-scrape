4150 - DISCIPLINE
Section: Support Staff
Date Created: October 2009
Date Edited: October 2009
The Board of Education directs all support staff members to observe statutes, rules of the State Board of Education, policies of this Board, and duly promulgated administrative rules and regulations governing staff conduct.
Violations of those statutes, rules, policies, and regulations will be subject to discipline.
The Superintendent or designee shall deal with disciplinary matters on a case by case basis.
Discipline will include, as appropriate, verbal and written warnings, transfer, suspension, freezing wages, and dismissal; discipline will provide, wherever possible, for progressive penalties for repeated violations.
In the event disciplinary action is contemplated, notice will be given to the employee in ordinary and concise language of the specific acts and omissions upon which the disciplinary action is based; the text of the statute, policy, rule, or regulation that the employee is alleged to have violated; a date when the employee may be heard and the administrator who will hear the matter; and the penalty that may be imposed.
