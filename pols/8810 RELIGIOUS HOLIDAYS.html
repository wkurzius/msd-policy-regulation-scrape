District Policy
8810 - RELIGIOUS HOLIDAYS
Section: Operations
Date Created: October 2009
Date Edited: October 2009
The Board of Education recognizes the acknowledgment of religious holidays in the public school may be a source of community concern.
It is a goal of the district educational program to teach mutual understanding and brotherhood and respect for group differences.
In pursuing this goal, the educational program may recognize that various religious groups celebrate different holidays with different practices.
In the acknowledgment or observance of any religious holiday, the Superintendent shall ensure the school and/or school officials do not mandate, organize, participate in an official capacity, endorse, persuade, compel, prevent or deny participation in constitutionally protected prayer or religion in violation of the governing principles of the First Amendment of the United States Constitution.
Consistent with these principles, the Superintendent shall ensure:
1.
No worship or religious service of any kind is sponsored by the school district and conducted during the school day, whether or not conducted by a clergyman;
2.
Religious exhibits or displays include only materials that are a necessary or integral part of the curriculum;
3.
Any religious music played is selected primarily for its artistic content; and
4.
Any acknowledgment of a religious holiday neither advances nor inhibits any particular religious sect or religion consistent with the governing principles of the First Amendment of the United States Constitution.
