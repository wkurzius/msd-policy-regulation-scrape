9280 - PARENT CONFERENCES
Section: Community
Date Created: October 2009
Date Edited: October 2009
The Board of Education endorses the parent-teacher conference as an effective means of permitting parent(s) or legal guardian(s) and teachers to share information about pupils and the educational program in a constructive setting.
The Superintendent is directed to schedule parent-teacher conferences at such times as will permit the maximum attendance of parent(s) or legal guardian(s), including working parent(s) or legal guardian(s); to encourage the participation of parent(s) or legal guardian(s); and to provide in-service training to teachers to assist them in making most effective use of the conference.
The Board believes that the information exchanged in parent-teacher conferences can be of great importance to the pupil's ability to profit educationally; such conferences are, therefore, an essential part of the instructional program and an integral part of a teacher's professional responsibility.
Accordingly, all teachers are required to attend the parent conferences scheduled for the children assigned to them.
A teacher's failure to observe this policy may be cause for discipline.
The Board regards parent-teacher conferences as non-adversarial meetings in which all persons present are united in a common interest in the educational well-being of the pupil.
The parent(s) or legal guardian(s) of the pupil may bring to the conference additional persons who share that interest and wish to aid the parent(s) or legal guardian(s) and the teacher.
When a parent(s) or legal guardian(s) desires the representation of legal counsel at the conference, however, the Board may wish to be similarly represented.
Accordingly, the parent(s) or legal guardian(s) who plans to bring legal counsel to a parent-teacher conference shall notify the school Principal of that intention no later than five working days in advance of the conference in order that the Superintendent may secure such legal representation as he/she may deem advisable.
The purposes of the parent-teacher conference are best served when all persons present share freely and candidly their knowledge of the pupil's educational progress and information relating to that progress.
Any person present may make and preserve notes, for his/her benefit, of the information shared and may, if permitted, make a tape recording of the conference as an aid to memory or to share with an absent parent or legal guardian.
Because the presence of the tape recorder may act to impede the free exchange necessary to an effective conference, however, either the parent(s) or legal guardian(s) or the teacher may refuse the other's request that a tape recorder be used.
