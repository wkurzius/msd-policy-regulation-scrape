Section: Support Staff
Date Created: October 2009
Date Edited: October 2009
M
The Board of Education shall maintain a working environment that is free from harassment of any kind.
Harassment is conduct by an employee which has the purpose or effect of creating an intimidating, hostile, or offensive working environment, has the purpose or effect of unreasonably interfering with an individual’s work performance, or otherwise similarly affects an individual’s employment opportunities.
Harassment includes, but is not limited to, that relating to an employee’s gender, national origin, or religious identification.
Employees are selected because of their ability, availability, capability, aptitude, experience, education, health and a willingness to work and serve.
Intimidating and generally threatening a subordinate may be viewed as unlawful harassment.
District employees are urged to be cognizant of the sensitivities and differing backgrounds of subordinates.
The Manville School District will not tolerate behavior which interferes with an employee’s progress and/or undermining the employee’s work.
Administrators and supervisors will make it clear to all staff, pupils, and vendors that harassment is prohibited.
The Board of Education recognizes that an employee's right to freedom from employment discrimination includes the opportunity to work in an environment untainted by sexual harassment.
Sexually offensive speech and conduct are wholly inappropriate to the harmonious employment relationships necessary to the operation of the school district and intolerable in a workplace to which the children of this district are exposed.
Sexual harassment includes all unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and verbal or physical contacts of a sexual nature that would not have happened but for the employee's gender.
Whenever submission to such conduct is made a condition of employment or a basis for an employment decision, or when such conduct is severe and pervasive and has the purpose or effect of unreasonably altering or interfering with work performance or creating an intimidating, hostile, or offensive working environment, the employee shall have cause for complaint.
The sexual harassment of any employee of this district is strictly forbidden.
Any employee or agent of this Board who is found to have sexually harassed an employee of this district will be subject to discipline, which may include termination of employment.
Any employee who has been exposed to sexual harassment by any employee or agent of this Board is encouraged to report the harassment to an appropriate supervisor.
An employee may complain of any failure of the Board to take corrective action by recourse to the procedure by which a discrimination complaint is processed.
The employee may appeal the Board's action or inaction to the New Jersey Division on Civil Rights or to the United States Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.
Complaints regarding sexual harassment shall be submitted following the procedures outlined in Regulation 1530, Equal Employment Opportunity.
The Superintendent shall instruct all employees of this Board to recognize and correct speech and behavior patterns that may be sexually offensive with or without the intent to offend.
