District Policy
2416.01 - POSTNATAL ACCOMMODATIONS FOR STUDENTS
Section: Program
Date Created: September 2022
Date Edited: September 2022
The Board of Education recognizes students may be returning to school shortly after their child’s birth and may need to breastfeed their child or to express breast milk during the school day.
The school district will accommodate a student who wants to breastfeed or express breast milk while attending school in the district.
A student shall be permitted to breastfeed their child or to express breast milk while attending school in accordance with a schedule provided by the student to the school nurse, who shall consult with the Principal or designee.
The district encourages the student develop a schedule that does not impact a student’s instructional time and encourages a student to schedule such time to breastfeed or to express breast milk during study hall time, lunch time, or other non-instructional times of the school day.
The student may bring to school a breast pump and any other equipment necessary to express breast milk on school grounds.
The student shall not incur an academic penalty for using any reasonable accommodations offered to the student and shall be provided the opportunity to make up any work missed due to such use.
The Principal or designee, in consultation with the school nurse, will designate a lactation/breastfeeding room that is shielded from view and free from intrusion by other students, staff members, and the public.
The location must be functional as a space for breastfeeding or expressing breast milk and shall include an electrical outlet, a chair, and nearby access to running water.
Expressed breast milk may be stored in a refrigerator in the school building or in the student’s personal cooler.
If the space is not a dedicated lactation/breastfeeding room, it must be available when needed.
A space temporarily converted into a lactation/breastfeeding room or made available when needed by the student is sufficient; however, a bathroom, even if private, is not a permissible location.
A student opting to breastfeed their child in the lactation/breastfeeding room will be responsible to make arrangements for their child to be brought to the school in accordance with a time schedule agreed to by the Principal or designee.
All staff members will assist in providing a positive atmosphere of support for students who are returning to school after the birth of their child.
Conduct by a staff member or student that reasonably interferes with a student’s performance in school; creates an intimidating, hostile, or offensive environment for a student that is complying with the provisions of this Policy; or that inhibits a student’s ability to breastfeed their child or express breast milk while in school will not be tolerated.
The Principal shall ensure Policy 2416.01 is distributed to pregnant students and students who are returning to school after the birth of their child.
