5250 - EXCUSAL FROM CLASS OR PROGRAM
Section: Students
Date Created: October 2009
Date Edited: October 2009
The Board of Education directs that a pupil be excused from any part of the instructions in health education, family life education, sex education, or instruction that includes dissection of animals that the parent(s) or legal guardian(s) of the pupil or the adult pupil finds morally, conscientiously, or religiously offensive.
A request for excusal must be presented in a signed statement and submitted to the Principal.
An excused pupil shall be assigned to an alternate program of independent study on a substitute topic within the health education, family life education, or sex education program.
The parent's or legal guardian's right of excusal applies to any alternate program as well.
No excused pupil will be penalized by loss of credit as a result of his/her excusal, but a pupil will be held accountable for successful completion of any alternate program assigned.
