District Policy
2270 - RELIGION IN THE SCHOOLS
Section: Program
Date Created: October 2009
Date Edited: June 2024
The Board of Education recognizes that religious belief and disbelief are matters of personal conviction rather than governmental authority and the students of this district are protected by the First Amendment of the United States Constitution and by Article I, Paragraph 4 of the New Jersey State Constitution from the establishment of religion in the schools.
The First Amendment requires public school officials to show neither favoritism toward nor hostility against religious expression such as prayer.
As a condition of receiving Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (ESEA) funds, the Board of Education must annually certify in writing to the New Jersey Department of Education that no Board policy prevents, or otherwise denies participation in, constitutionally protected prayer in public elementary and secondary schools, as detailed in the United States Department of Education’s Guidance on Constitutionally Protected Prayer and Religious Expression in Public Elementary and Secondary Schools (USDOE Guidance).
The Board must provide this certification to the New Jersey Department of Education by October 1 of each year during which the Board participates in an ESEA program.
The USDOE Guidance provides information on the current state of the law concerning constitutionally protected prayer and religious expression in public elementary and secondary schools.
The following activities as outlined in the USDOE Guidance will be permitted upon applying the governing constitutional principles in particular public school contexts related to prayer: prayer and religious exercise during non-instructional time; organized prayer groups and activities; teachers, administrators, and other school employees; moments of silence; accommodation of prayer and religious exercise during instructional time; student assemblies and noncurricular events; prayer at graduation; and/or baccalaureate ceremonies.
The following activities as outlined in the USDOE Guidance will be permitted upon applying constitutional principles regarding religious expression other than prayer in particular public school contexts:  religious literature; teaching about religion; student dress codes and policies; religious expression in class assignments and homework; and/or excusals for religious activities.
In addition to the constitutional principles outlined in this Policy and the USDOE Guidance, public schools may also be subject to requirements under Federal and State laws relevant to prayer and religious expression.
Such Federal and State laws may not; however, obviate or conflict with a public school's Federal constitutional obligations described in the USDOE Guidance.
The Equal Access Act, 20 U.S.C.
Section 4071, is designed to ensure that student religious activities are accorded the same access to Federally funded public secondary school facilities as are student secular activities.
The United States Department of Justice has developed guidance for interpreting the Equal Access Act’s requirements outlined in the USDOE Guidance in the area of general provisions, prayer service and worship exercises, means of publicized meetings, lunch-time and recess, and leadership of religious student groups.
Any issues regarding prayer and religious expression in the schools, the USDOE Guidance, and the provisions of this Policy shall be referred to the Superintendent of Schools who may consult with the Board Attorney.
