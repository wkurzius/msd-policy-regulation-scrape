District Policy
8470 - RESPONSE TO CONCERTED JOB ACTION
Section: Operations
Date Created: October 2009
Date Edited: October 2009
In the event of an emergency brought about by a job action, including a strike, by any employee group, the Board and the school attorney shall be immediately informed.
It shall be the policy of the Board of Education to make every effort to keep schools open and to carry out its obligation under New Jersey State Law, Title 18A, to educate the children of the community.
Since there is no authorization in law for job actions, and since such actions are constitutionally prohibited, including strikes, by public employees, it shall be the policy of the Board, in the event of any job action, including a strike or any other act that withholds employee services from the Board, to take appropriate legal action to deal with such a matter.
In emergency situations under this policy, all usual policy adoption procedures shall be suspended for the duration of the emergency, and the Board may adopt policies on first reading to enable the Board to maintain operation of the schools and the safety and welfare of the community, pupils and employees.
The Superintendent or his/her designee shall have the authority to take such immediate emergency steps as he/she deems necessary to ensure the safety and well-being of pupils and employees and to protect the property of the district.
