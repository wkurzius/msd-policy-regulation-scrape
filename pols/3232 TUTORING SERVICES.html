3232 - TUTORING SERVICES
Section: Teaching Staff Members
Date Created: October 2013
Date Edited: October 2013
School staff members routinely provide time beyond their assigned responsibilities to pupils who need additional help in their academic programs.
This additional help is provided by a staff member on school grounds during their free time during their workday or immediately before or after school hours.
The time a staff member provides additional help to a pupil is an extension of their assigned school district responsibilities and a staff member may not charge a fee for providing this additional help to pupils.
However, the Board of Education recognizes a school staff member may be privately contracted to provide tutoring services to a pupil in addition to any additional help a pupil receives before, during, and/or after the school day.
School staff members are prohibited from providing private tutoring services to pupils currently enrolled in their classes or to a pupil who the staff member participates as a member of the pupil's evaluation team.
These tutoring services shall be provided to a pupil under a private agreement between the staff member and the parent and/or pupil.
Private tutoring shall not take place on school grounds.
The Board of Education assumes no responsibility, liability, or obligations for the selection of the private tutor or the quality of the private tutoring services.
School staff members shall not provide private tutoring services for a fee or any compensation to any pupil that is currently enrolled in their classes.
