Section: Program
Date Created: October 2009
Date Edited: September 2022
M
The Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) is a reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) of 1965 that provides Federal funds to help all New Jersey’s school children achieve.
The purpose of the ESSA is to ensure all students have equitable access to high-quality educational resources and opportunities and to close educational achievement gaps.
The Board of Education elects to augment the instructional program of students by projects supported by Federal funds allocated under the ESSA and the district will comply with the requirements of all the programs authorized by the ESSA.
The district may be eligible for several grant programs funded through the ESSA, including, but not limited to, Title I through Title VII.
Many of the Titles of the ESSA have several parts and subparts that provide a funding source for specific purposes.
Application Procedure
The district will submit an annual ESSA Consolidated Formula Subgrant Application to the New Jersey Department of Education (NJDOE).
The school district’s application shall include all information required by the NJDOE and the ESSA for the district to be considered for funding under the ESSA.
Covered Programs
Formula grants under the ESSA are non-competitive grants that school districts are eligible for based on the make-up of their student bodies.
These formula grants for each Title are committed to different purposes and may be used to support different activities and programs.
Title I
The largest Federal program supporting elementary and secondary education is Title I.
The ESSA strengthens Title I requirements for the State’s assessments, accountability system, and support for school improvement.
The law also requires minimum qualifications for teachers and paraprofessionals in Title I programs.
The school district must use the best available measure for identifying children from low-income families to:  identify eligible school attendance areas, determine the ranking of each area, and determine allocations as identified in the Title I guidelines and regulations.
The school district will offer Title I services to eligible children enrolled in private elementary and secondary schools.
The services and benefits will be equitable in comparison to services and benefits for participating public school children.
The school district will provide the New Jersey Department of Education assurances it will provide the maximum coordination between the Title I program, the regular school program, and services provided by other programs for specialized populations.
The Title I program will consider the special needs of homeless children, migrant children, children with disabilities and limited English Language Learner (ELL) children.
Title I funds will be reserved so that migrant children who are otherwise eligible to receive Title I services, even if they arrive during the school year, are served.
Type of Title I Program
The school district will offer a School-wide Title I program.
School-wide Program
High-poverty schools (a school with at least 40% poverty or any school below 40% poverty with a waiver issued by the New Jersey Department of Education) are eligible to adopt school-wide programs to raise the achievement of low-achieving students by improving instruction throughout the entire school, thus using Title I funds to serve all children in the school.
A school-wide program must be established in accordance with the Title I guidelines and regulations and the New Jersey Department of Education.
New Jersey Department of Education Accountability System
The district will comply with the accountability system established by the New Jersey Department of Education and outlined in the New Jersey State Plan and approved by the United States Department of Education.
Fiscal Responsibility
The district will comply with the requirements as outlined in Policy 2415.02   Title I – Fiscal Responsibilities in accordance with the NJDOE and the ESSA.
Staff
The district will comply with the staff certification requirements of the ESSA and the NJDOE.
In addition, the district will ensure all paraprofessionals meet the requirements as established by the ESSA and as outlined in Policy 4125 – Employment of Support Staff Members.

The district will comply with the requirements as outlined in Policy 2415.04 – Title I – District-Wide Parent and Family Engagement and Policy 2415.50 – Title I – School Parent and Family Engagement as applicable in accordance with the NJDOE and the ESSA.
Student Surveys, Analysis, and/or Evaluations
The Protection of Pupil Rights Amendment (PPRA) applies to school districts that receive Federal funding from the United States Department of Education.
The district will comply with the requirements as outlined in Policy 2415.05 - Student Surveys, Analysis, and/or Evaluations in accordance with the PPRA.
Unsafe School Choice Option

Property
Property acquired through Title I funds for use in public or private schools will be acquired in accordance with the Public School Contracts Law, will be held in title by the 
Board of Education, and will not be used for other purposes so long as it is required in the Title I program.
Property no longer required for Title I purposes will be used for other, similarly funded projects or disposed of in accordance with State and Federal guidelines.
Capital Expenses
The Superintendent will assure the district abides by New Jersey’s Public Contracts Law; consults appropriate private school officials prior to making any decisions regarding capital expenses; ensure funds that are received to cover capital expenses provide equitable Title I services to private school students; ensure accounts for any capital funding is separately maintained; and assure lease purchase agreements are consistent with applicable statute and administrative code.
Post-Award Requirements
The school district will maintain all project records for five years following the completion of the activity for which the funds were used.
The school district will prepare and submit all reports as required by the State Department of Education in a timely manner.
Supplement, Not Supplant
Grant funds provided under Federal programs, including the ESEA of 1965 as amended by the ESSA, shall supplement, not supplant the funds that would, in the absence of such Federal funds, be made available from State and local sources for the education of students participating in programs assisted under the ESEA of 1965 as amended by the ESSA.
Evaluation
The Superintendent or designee will evaluate the ESSA programs as required by the United States and the New Jersey Departments of Education.
