4324 - RIGHT OF PRIVACY
Section: Support Staff
Date Created: April 2012
Date Edited: March 2012
The Board of Education will provide facilities and school district-owned property to assist staff members in their job responsibilities or for the staff membersâ€™ convenience.
These facilities or district-owned property may include, but are not limited to, an office, a storage closet, a filing cabinet, a locker, and/or a desk.
The Principal or designee may provide a staff member with exclusive use and access to such facilities or school district-owned property or may require the facility or school district-owned property be shared with other staff members.
The staff member may be provided a lock or key by the school district or may secure the facility or school district-owned property using their own locking device with permission from the Principal or designee, or immediate supervisor.
School staff members should be aware their expectation of privacy in these facilities and/or the school district-owned property provided by the Board of Education is reduced by virtue of actual office practices and procedures, for searches conducted pursuant to an investigation of work-related employee misconduct, or by legitimate school district policies or regulations.
In addition, staff members shall have a reduced expectation of privacy in these facilities and school district-owned property if there is reasonable suspicion the staff member is violating a law or school policy.
School staff members shall be on notice this reduced expectation of privacy may result in such facilities and/or school district-owned property being searched without a search warrant.
In order to avoid exposing personal belongings to such a search, school staff members are discouraged from storing personal papers and effects in these facilities or school district-owned property.
