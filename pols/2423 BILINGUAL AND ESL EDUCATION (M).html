The Board of Education will provide programs of bilingual education, English as a second language (ESL), and English language services program for English language learners (ELLs) as required by law and rules of the New Jersey State Board of Education.

Identification of Eligible ELLs
The district shall use a multi-step process at the time of enrollment to determine the native language of each ELL.
The district shall:
1.
Maintain a census indicating all identified students whose native language is other than English; and
2.
Administer the Statewide home-language survey to determine which students in Kindergarten to grade twelve whose native language is other than English must be screened further to determine English language proficiency.
The Statewide home-language survey shall be administered by a bilingual/ESL or other certified teacher and shall be designed to distinguish students who are proficient English speakers and need no further testing.
The district shall determine the English language proficiency of all Kindergarten to grade twelve students who are not screened out and whose native language is other than English by administering an English language proficiency test, assessing the level of reading in English, reviewing the previous academic performance of students, including their performance on standardized tests in English, and reviewing the input of teaching staff members responsible for the educational program for ELLs.
Students who do not meet the New Jersey Department of Education (Department) standard on a language proficiency test and who have at least one other indicator shall be considered ELLs.
The district shall also use age-appropriate methodologies to identify preschool ELLs to determine their individual language development needs.
