The Board of Education believes that all school district property should be respected and all persons who use or have access to school district property should respect such property and take pride in the institutions of this community and the schools of this district.
Any person who purposely or knowingly damages school district property or damages school district property recklessly or negligently in the employment of fire, explosives or another dangerous means listed in accordance with N.J.S.A.

Where the damage to district property is more than minimal or has been caused by a pupil or a minor not a pupil of this district, the Board will hold liable for the amount of the damage the parent(s) or legal guardian(s) having legal custody and control of the minor responsible for the damage.
A person convicted of an offense that involves an act of graffiti will be required to reimburse the school district the cost of damages and may be required to perform community service, which may include removing the graffiti from the property, in accordance with the law.
In addition, the courts may suspend or postpone driving privileges of any person, at least thirteen and under eighteen years of age, if convicted of an act of graffiti.
A person who purposely defaces or damages district property with any symbol that exposes persons to violence, contempt, or hatred on the basis of race, color, creed, religion, national origin, ancestry, age, marital status, affectational or sexual orientation or sex, social or economic status, or disability is guilty of a crime and shall be reported to appropriate law enforcement authorities.
The Board may also report to the appropriate law enforcement agencies any person whose vandalism of school property is serious or chronic.
The Superintendent shall develop regulations to implement this policy and to protect textbooks, school equipment, and school facilities from undue wear, damage, or loss.
