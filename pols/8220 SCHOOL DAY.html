8220 - SCHOOL DAY
Section: Operations
Date Created: October 2009
Date Edited: July 2020
The Board of Education shall annually approve the times that school(s) will be in session, including the starting and ending time of a shortened day.
A school day shall be in accordance with N.J.A.C.
6A:32-8.3.
The schools of the district will be in session for students on those days and times recommended by the Superintendent and annually approved by the Board.
The Superintendent may close school, delay the opening of school, or dismiss school early when such alteration in the regular session is required for the protection of the health and safety of students and staff members or other good cause.
A shortened school day, whether it is planned or emergent (as in the case of inclement weather), must meet certain requirements in order to count toward the one hundred eighty day requirement of N.J.S.A.
18A:7F-9.
The Superintendent shall inform the Board President of any such alteration as soon as possible and shall prepare rules for the proper and timely notification of concerned persons in the event of any delayed opening or emergency school closing.
