5338 - DIABETES MANAGEMENT (M)
Section: Students
Date Created: October 2009
Date Edited: March 2010
M
Diabetes is a serious chronic disease and must be managed twenty-four hours a day in order to avoid the potentially life-threatening short-term consequences of blood sugar levels that are either too high or too low and the serious long-term complications of high blood sugar levels.
In order to manage their diabetes, pupils must have access to the means to balance food, medications, and physical activity level while at school and at school-related activities.
The parent or legal guardian of a pupil with diabetes who seeks diabetes care for the pupil while at school shall inform the school nurse who shall develop an individualized health care plan and an individualized emergency health care plan for the pupil.
The individualized health care plan and individualized emergency health care plan shall be updated by the school nurse prior to the beginning of each school year and as necessary in the event there is a change in the health status of the pupil.
The school nurse assigned to a particular school shall coordinate the provision of diabetes care at that school and ensure that appropriate staff members are trained in the care of pupils with diabetes, including staff members working with school-sponsored programs outside of the regular school day, as provided in the individualized health care plan and the individualized emergency health care plan.
The school nurse shall have the primary responsibility for the emergency administration of glucagon to a pupil with diabetes who is experiencing severe hypoglycemia.
The school nurse shall designate, in consultation with the Superintendent of Schools or designee, additional employees of the school district who volunteer to administer glucagon to a pupil with diabetes who is experiencing severe hypoglycemia.
The designated employees shall only be authorized to administer glucagon, following training by the school nurse or other qualified health care professional, when a school nurse is not physically present at the scene.
Upon the written request of the parent or legal guardian and as provided in a pupil’s individualized health care plan, the pupil will be permitted to manage and care for his/her diabetes as needed in the classroom, in any area of the school or school grounds, or at any school-related activity provided the pupil has been evaluated and determined to be capable of doing so as reflected in the pupil’s individualized health care plan.
The Principal or school nurse shall, for each pupil with diabetes whom a school bus driver transports, provide the driver with a notice of the pupil’s condition, how to treat hypoglycemia, who to contact in an emergency, and parent(s) or legal guardian(s) contact information.
Designated areas of the school building shall have posted, in plain view, a reference sheet identifying signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia in pupils with diabetes.
A pupil’s school choice, if there is a choice option, shall not be restricted due to the fact the pupil has diabetes.
