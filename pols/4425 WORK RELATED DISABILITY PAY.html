4425 - WORK RELATED DISABILITY PAY
Section: Support Staff
Date Created: October 2009
Date Edited: October 2009
The Board of Education will permit, in accordance with law, the absence without loss of pay or of annual or accumulated sick leave benefits of a support staff member disabled by accident or injury arising out of and in the course of employment.
Any such employee shall seek the workers' compensation benefits to which he/she is entitled by law.
An employee whose disability has qualified for the receipt of workers' compensation benefits shall be presumed eligible for work related disability pay under this policy.
When an employee's disability is so brief as to preclude the employee's application for worker's compensation benefits, the employee may request and the Board may grant work related disability pay.
Any employee who qualified for work related disability pay under this policy shall receive full pay during the period he/she is on disability leave of absence, up to one calendar year.
As a condition of receiving full salary, an employee who receives workers' compensation benefits for his/her work-related disability must endorse and deliver to the Board all workers' compensation temporary disability checks received for the period covered by this policy.
