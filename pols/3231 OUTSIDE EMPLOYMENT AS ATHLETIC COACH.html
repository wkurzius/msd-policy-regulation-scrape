The Board of Education will permit, in accordance with this Policy, staff members of this school district to serve as an athletic coach in another school district providing the responsibilities in the other district do not interfere with the performance of the staff member’s professional responsibilities in this district.
A staff member who wishes to accept employment as an athletic coach in another school district must request and receive permission to do so from the Superintendent of this district if the staff member may need to request any special accommodation(s) from this school district to fulfill their coaching responsibilities in another school district.
A special accommodation may be consideration for a requested duty assignment(s), a temporary work schedule adjustment and/or other considerations.
A special accommodation will not be considered if it would violate any provisions of any collective bargaining agreement within the district.
The staff member’s request to the Superintendent must be in writing and must indicate with specificity the accommodation(s) that may be required.
The Superintendent, in consultation with the staff member’s Building Principal and/or immediate supervisor, will evaluate each request on a case-by-case basis.
