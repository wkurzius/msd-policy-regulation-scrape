Section: Program
Date Created: October 2009
Date Edited: April 2017
The Board of Education recognizes that a system of measuring, recording, and reporting the achievements of individual pupils is important to the continuing process of learning.
The Board, therefore, directs the instructional program of this school district include a system of grading that measures progress toward the New Jersey Student Learning Standards and the educational goals of the district.
Pupils shall be informed at the outset of any course of study of the behaviors and achievements that are expected of them and shall be kept informed of their progress during the course of study.
As a rule, grading should reward pupils for positive efforts and minimize failure, and pupils should be encouraged to evaluate their own achievements.
The Superintendent shall develop and continually review in consultation with teaching staff members, parent(s) or legal guardian(s), and pupils, a grading program appropriate to the course of study and maturity of pupils.
The final decision on any contested grade will be the responsibility of the Principal.
A pupil classified as disabled will be graded in accordance with his/her Individualized Educational Program (IEP) or the Section 504 Plan.
