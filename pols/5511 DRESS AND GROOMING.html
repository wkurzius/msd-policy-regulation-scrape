District Policy
5511 - DRESS AND GROOMING
Section: Students
Date Created: October 2009
Date Edited: October 2009
The Board of Education required pupils to comply with the expectations for sound choices in personal grooming and in the wearing of attire.
Within the guidelines set forth by the administration, pupils may exercise their own judgment in matters of dress and hair style, unless the choices pupils make present a danger to the pupilsâ€™ health and safety of themselves or others, cause an interference with work, or create classroom or school disorder.
Guidelines for implementing and enforcing this policy are to be prepared by the Superintendent in conjunction with those members of the school community that he/she may choose.
