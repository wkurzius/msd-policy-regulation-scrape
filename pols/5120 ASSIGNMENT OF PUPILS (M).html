The placement of such children shall be made at the discretion of the Principal in the best interest of the school and its pupils.
The parent may appeal the Principal’s classroom placement decision to the Board of Education, which shall make a final determination on the placement.
The written request must be submitted to the Principal no later than fourteen days after the first day of each school year.
Parents of twins or higher order multiples enrolling after the school year commences shall request the classroom placement in writing no later than fourteen days after the first day of attendance.
In accordance with the provisions of N.J.S.A.
18A:36-38.(2)(b), a Principal may, after consultation with the pupils’ parent and teachers at the end of the initial grading period, request the Board make a different classroom placement determination for the twins or higher order multiples if the initial classroom placement is determined to be disruptive to any of the pupils in the class or classes, or if the Principal concludes the initial placement does not sufficiently support the pupils’ academic or social development.
Upon receiving such request, the Board shall make a final classroom placement determination.
“Higher order multiples” means triplets, quadruplets, quintuplets, or larger group siblings born at one birth.
Provisions of N.J.S.A.
18A:36-38 do not apply to a school district which maintains only a single classroom for the grade level in which twins or higher order multiples are enrolled.
The parent shall be responsible for any additional pupil transportation costs that are incurred by the district as a result of providing the requested classroom placement, unless the district is in agreement with the placement.
In the event one of the twins or higher order multiples receives special education services, the requested placement shall not be accommodated if the placement is inconsistent with a pupil’s Individualized Education Plan.
