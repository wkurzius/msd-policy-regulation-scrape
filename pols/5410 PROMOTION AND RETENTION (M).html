Section: Students
Date Created: October 2009

M
The following standards are promulgated in accordance with the policy of the Board of Education dealing with promotion and retention of pupils.
Grades K-5:    Performance in reading/language arts and math skills will be given primary consideration in recommending retention of a pupil.
Secondary considerations regarding retention shall include social/emotional growth, motor skills and work/study habits.
Grades 6-8:     If a pupil fails three academic subjects (language arts, mathematics, science and social studies), he or she may not be promoted.
If a pupil fails two academic subjects, he or she must attend summer school and pass at least one of those subjects to be promoted.
If a pupil fails only one academic subject, he or she may be promoted but the pupil will be strongly encouraged to attend summer school for the academic subject failed.
The attendance of the student in alignment with Policy 5200 Attendance will be a consideration.
Grades 9-12:   A pupil will be promoted to the next grade when he or she has completed, in the current school year, the number of credits required for that grade as indicated in the current high school pupil handbook.
Each pupil will be promoted to the next grade annually in June providing he/she   has shown the progress expected for such a move upward.
For any pupil (Kindergarten through twelve) failing by the end of the second marking period with the possibility of being retained in the same grade level, the Principal will meet with the parent(s) or legal guardian(s) and teachers to establish intervention strategies that will enable the pupil to be promoted.
When evaluation of the pupil's progress does not indicate such growth, the Principal shall notify the Superintendent by April 1 and the pupil's parent(s) or legal guardian(s) by April 15 of the possibility of retention.
The Principal, after consultation with teachers, parent(s) or legal guardian(s), and appropriate school personnel, shall decide whether to promote a pupil or retain him/her at grade level; attendance and truancy factors will be reviewed in alignment with Policy 5200 Attendance and will be a consideration.
The Principal is also responsible for informing the Superintendent by June 1 of the tentative list of pupils being retained and the final list as soon as it is available.
