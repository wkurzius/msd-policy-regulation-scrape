Section: Students
Date Created: October 2009
Date Edited: June 2024
The Board of Education will admit and enroll homeless children and youths in accordance with Federal and State laws and New Jersey Administrative Code.
The Board of Education adopts this Policy to be in compliance with law and administrative code to ensure the enrollment of homeless children and youths in school and to respond to appeals made by parents or other parties related to the enrollment of homeless children and youths.
The Board shall determine that a child or youth is homeless when the child or youth resides in a publicly or privately operated shelter designed to provide temporary living accommodations, including:  hotels or motels; congregate shelters, including domestic violence and runaway shelters; transitional housing; and homes for adolescent mothers.
A child or youth is also determined homeless when the child or youth resides in a public or private place not designated for or ordinarily used as a regular sleeping accommodation, including:  cars or other vehicles including mobile homes; tents or other temporary shelters; parks; abandoned buildings; bus or train stations; or temporary shelters provided to migrant workers and their children on farm sites.
A child or youth is determined homeless when the child or youth resides in the residence of relatives or friends where the homeless child or youth resides out of necessity because the child’s or youth’s family lacks a regular or permanent residence of its own.
A child or youth is also determined homeless when the child or youth resides in substandard housing.
The school district of residence for a homeless child or youth is responsible for the education of the child and shall assume all responsibilities as required in N.J.A.C.
6A:17-2.3.
The school district of residence for a homeless child or youth means the school district in which the parent of a homeless child or youth resided prior to becoming homeless.
A school district liaison will be designated by the Superintendent of Schools for the education of homeless children and youths.
The school district liaison will facilitate communication and cooperation between the school district of residence and the school district where the homeless child or youth resides and shall assume all responsibilities as outlined in N.J.A.C.
6A:17-2.4(a).
When a homeless child or youth resides in a school district, the school district liaison shall notify the liaison of the school district of residence within twenty-four hours of receiving notification from the parent, a shelter director, or an involved agency.
Upon notification of the need for enrollment of a homeless child or youth, the liaison in the school district of residence shall coordinate enrollment procedures immediately based upon the best interest of the child pursuant to N.J.A.C.
6A:17-2.5(b).
The Superintendent of the school district of residence or designee shall decide in which school district the homeless child or youth shall be enrolled in accordance with the provisions of N.J.A.C.

Unless parental rights have been terminated by a court of competent jurisdiction, the parent retains all rights under N.J.A.C.

When a dispute occurs regarding the determination of homelessness or the determination of the school district of enrollment made by the school district of residence, the Superintendent(s) or the designee(s) of the involved district(s) or the child’s or youth’s parent(s) shall immediately notify the Executive County Superintendent of Schools, who, in consultation with the New Jersey Department of Education’s (NJDOE) McKinney-Vento Homeless Education Coordinator or the Coordinator’s designee, shall immediately decide the child’s or youth’s status.
If a dispute remains between the parent and the involved school district(s) following the Executive County Superintendent’s determination, the parent or the involved district Board(s) of Education may appeal to the Commissioner of Education for determination pursuant to N.J.A.C.
6A:3, Controversies and Disputes.
When a school district designated as the school district of residence disputes its designation as the school district of residence, or where no designation can be agreed upon by the involved school districts, the Superintendent(s) or designee(s) of the involved school districts shall immediately notify the Executive County Superintendent of Schools.
The Executive County Superintendent shall make a determination immediately, if possible, but no later than within forty-eight hours and, when necessary, in consultation with the NJDOE’s Homeless Education Coordinator or the Coordinator’s designee.
If the dispute regarding determination of the school district of residence does not involve the determination of homelessness and/or school district of enrollment, the school district disputing the Executive County Superintendent’s determination may appeal to the NJDOE pursuant to N.J.A.C.
6A:23A-19.2(d), (e), and (f) and request a determination from the NJDOE Division of Administration and Finance.
If an appeal of a determination of school district of residence also includes an appeal of the determination of homelessness and/or school district of enrollment, the appeal shall be submitted to the Commissioner of Education pursuant to N.J.A.C.
6A:3, Controversies and Disputes.
Any dispute or appeal shall not delay the homeless child’s or youth’s immediate enrollment or continued enrollment in the school district.
The homeless child or youth shall be enrolled in the school district in which enrollment or continued enrollment is sought by the parent, pending resolution of the dispute or appeal.
Disputes and appeals involving the services provided to a homeless child or youth with a disability shall be made pursuant to N.J.A.C.
