District Policy
8860 - MEMORIALS
Section: Operations
Date Created: October 2009
Date Edited: October 2009
The Board of Education recognizes that each officer and employee of this district is important not only to the school district but to the community at large.
The loss of any officer or employee of this Board by death is a loss that the Board and the district share with the community.
In order to memorialize that loss in a fitting manner, the Board directs that, whenever notice is received of the death of a Board member or a person employed by the Board, the flag of the United States at each school district building shall be flown at half mast for one school day.
Written notice shall be posted in an appropriate manner in each district building on that day in order that pupils, staff members, and visitors are informed of the purpose of the memorialization.
The Superintendent may, in his/her discretion, grant an employee of this district a brief absence without loss of pay or personal leave for the purpose of attending the funeral of his/her direct supervisor or subordinate provided that no disruption in the educational program will be caused by any such absence.
The Superintendent shall recommend to the Board and the Board may approve appropriate recognition measures beyond those provided for in this policy when the deceased Board officer or employee has, by length of service or extraordinary accomplishment, especially distinguished his/her service to this school district.
Adopted:  20 October 2009
