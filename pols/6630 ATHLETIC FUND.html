The Board of Education directs the establishment of an athletic fund for the financial administration of the interscholastic athletic program.
Moneys may be collected from and disbursed for only the interscholastic athletic program duly approved by the Board of Education.
The Board will facilitate the interscholastic athletic program by providing sufficient funds to overcome any deficit existing in the athletic fund at the conclusion of the school year.

The fund will be audited annually and will be administered under appropriate accounting controls.
The books of account will include income and expenses separately for each approved athletic program.
All gate receipts must be turned in to the Business office within twenty-four hours of collection or the next business day and must be deposited on the day they are received.
In no case shall money be left overnight in schools, except in the school safe provided for safekeeping of valuables.
All payments for supplies, equipment, and services for the interscholastic athletic program will be made in accordance with established purchasing procedures of the district except that fees for referees, ticket takers, and security personnel and purchases in amounts under $50.00 will be exempted from those procedures.
Purchase orders for goods and services purchased through the athletic fund will be approved by the Board of Education.
Disbursements from the athletic fund will be made by check and approved by the Board of Education.
At the conclusion of each athletic program, the Athletic Director shall submit a complete inventory of all equipment and supplies to the Superintendent or designee.
All equipment and supplies that are replaced will be disposed of in accordance with policies and procedures established by the New Jersey Department of Education.
