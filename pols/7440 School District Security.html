The Board of Education believes the buildings and facilities of the school district represent a substantial community investment.
The Board directs the development and implementation of a plan for school district security to protect the school community’s investment in the school buildings and facilities.
The Board will comply with the security measures required in N.J.S.A.
18A:7G-5.2 for new school construction and for existing school buildings.
The school district security program will include:  maintenance of facilities that are secure against unwelcome intrusion; protection against fire hazards and faulty equipment; and compliance with safe practices in the use of electrical, plumbing, heating, and other school building equipment.
As used in this Policy and N.J.S.A.
18A:41-7.1, “critical incident mapping data” means information provided in electronic or digital form to assist first responders in an emergency including, but not limited to:  aerial images of schools; floor plans, including room and suite numbers; building access points; locations of hazardous materials and utility shut-offs; and any other relevant location information.
The Board shall provide to local law enforcement authorities critical incident mapping data for all schools and school grounds.
In the case of a school building located in a municipality in which there is no municipal police department, critical incident mapping data shall be provided to an entity designated by the Superintendent of the New Jersey State Police.
The Board shall provide revised mapping data to the applicable law enforcement authorities or designated entities any time that there is a change to the critical incident mapping data.
Critical incident mapping data provided pursuant to N.J.S.A.
18A:41-7.1.a.
shall be:  compatible with all platforms and applications used by local, State, and Federal law enforcement authorities; provided in a printable format; and verified for accuracy through an annual walkthrough of school buildings and school grounds.
Nothing in this Policy or N.J.S.A.
18A:41-7.1 shall be construed to require local law enforcement authorities or designated entities to access critical incident mapping data using third party viewing software.
The Board directs close cooperation of district officials with law enforcement, fire officials, and other emergency agencies.
Each public elementary and secondary school building shall be equipped with at least one panic alarm for use in a school security emergency pursuant to N.J.S.A.
18A:41-10 through 13 and this Policy and Regulation 7440.
The Superintendent of Schools shall designate a school administrator, or a school employee with expertise in school safety and security, as a School Safety Specialist for the district in accordance with the provisions of N.J.S.A.
18A:17-43.3 and this Policy and Regulation 7440.
The School Safety Specialist shall be required to acquire a New Jersey Department of Education School Safety Specialist certification in accordance with the provisions of N.J.S.A.
18A:17-43.2 and this Policy and Regulation 7440.
The School Safety Specialist shall also serve as the school district liaison with local law enforcement and national, State, and community agencies and organizations in matters of school safety and security.
Access to school buildings and grounds outside the hours school is in session shall be limited to personnel whose employment requires their presence in the facility.
An adequate key control system will be established to limit building access to authorized personnel and guard against the potential of intrusion by unauthorized persons who have obtained access improperly.
In accordance with N.J.S.A.
18A:7G-5.2.b.(15), propping open doors to buildings on school grounds is strictly prohibited and students and staff shall not open a door for any individual.
All persons seeking entry into the building shall be directed to the main entrance.
Building records and funds shall be kept in a safe place and secured as appropriate and necessary.
Protective devices designed to be used as safeguards against illegal entry and vandalism may be installed when appropriate.
The Board may approve the employment of school resource officers, school security officers, and/or law enforcement officers in situations in which special risks are involved.
The school district shall annually conduct a school safety audit for each school building in accordance with the provisions of N.J.S.A.
18A:41-14.
