5230 - LATE ARRIVAL AND EARLY DISMISSAL
Section: Students
Date Created: October 2009
Date Edited: October 2009
The Board of Education requires that pupils be in attendance for the full school day in order to benefit from the instructional program.
That requirement will be waived only when compelling circumstances require that a pupil be late to school or dismissed from school before the end of the school day.
The Principal may excuse for cause the late arrival and early dismissal of a pupil on the prior written request of the pupil's parent(s) or legal guardian(s).
Good cause may include, but need not be limited to, medical and dental appointments that cannot be scheduled outside the school day, medical disability, a motor vehicle driver's test, interviews for college entrance or employment, and court appearances.
No pupil will be permitted to leave the school before the end of the school day except in the presence of the pupil's parent(s) or legal guardian(s), or an agent of the parent(s) or legal guardian(s) who has written authorization, or in the custody of agents of the state acting in their legal capacity.
The Principal shall maintain a record of the parent(s) or legal guardian(s) of each pupil.
If one parent has been assigned custody of the pupil by court order or separation agreement and wishes to limit the noncustodial parent's access to the pupil, the parent in custody must inform the Principal of any such limitation and may request that his/her authorization be required before the noncustodial parent is granted access.
In the absence of such notice, the Principal will presume that a pupil may be released into the care of either parent.
A pupil who suffers an incapacitating medical disability will be released from school only in the presence of an adult.
Adopted:  20 October 2009
