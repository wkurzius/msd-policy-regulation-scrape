8442 - REPORTING ACCIDENTS
Section: Operations
Date Created: October 2009
Date Edited: October 2009
The Board of Education directs that all reasonable efforts be made to ensure a safe learning and working environment for the pupils and employees of this district.
To that end and to the end that legitimate employee claims for worker's compensation be expedited, the Board requires that accidents be reported and evaluated.
Any accident that results in an injury, however slight, to a pupil, an employee of the Board, or a visitor to the schools must be reported promptly and in writing to the district business office.
Injured persons shall be referred immediately to the school nurse for such medical attention as may be appropriate.
The injured employee or visitor or the staff member responsible for an injured pupil shall complete a form, available in the office of the Building Principal, that includes the date, time and place of the incident; the names of persons involved; the nature of the injury, to the extent that it is known; and a description of all relevant circumstances.
A copy shall be retained by the Building Principal and a copy shall be sent to the business office.
Any employee of the Board who suffers a job-related injury must report the injury and its circumstances to the Building Principal or job supervisor, as appropriate, no later than twenty-four hours following the occurrence of the injury.
The failure of an employee to comply with this mandate may result in disciplinary action.
Adopted:  20 October 2009
