0133 - ADJUDICATION OF DISPUTE
Section: Bylaws
Date Created: October 2009
Date Edited: October 2009
The Board of Education may assume jurisdiction over any dispute or controversy arising within this school district and concerning any matter over which authority has been vested in the Board by statute, rule of the State Board of Education, or a contract or policy of this Board.
The Board may hold hearings that will offer the parties to a dispute, on notice duly given, a fair and impartial forum for the resolution of the matter.
Beyond the basic requirements of due process a hearing will vary in form and content as dictated by the severity of the consequences that may flow from the Board's determination, the degree of difficulty of establishing findings of fact from conflicting evidence, and the impact of the Board's decision on the school district.
Regulations for the conduct of adjudicatory hearings of the Board shall be prepared as guidelines for those who may be heard by the Board.
A decision of the Board may be appealed to the Commissioner of Education.
