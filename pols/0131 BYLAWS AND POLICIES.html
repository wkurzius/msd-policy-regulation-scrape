Section: Bylaws
Date Created: October 2009
Date Edited: October 2021
The Board of Education shall exercise its rule-making power by adopting, revising, and abolishing bylaws, policies, and regulations for the organization and operation of the school district.
“Regulations” for the purpose of this Bylaw are only those regulations that are required to be adopted by the Board.
Adoption, Amendment, and Abolishment
Bylaws, policies, and regulations may be adopted, and revised at any meeting of the Board, provided the proposed adoption or revision has been approved by the Board at a previous meeting of the Board.
Bylaws, policies, or regulations may be abolished at any meeting of the Board without the proposed abolishing of the proposed bylaw, policy, or regulation being approved by the Board at a previous meeting of the Board.
The Board shall at its organization meeting or annually at a meeting of the Board and by a majority vote of those present and voting, readopt existing bylaws, policies, and regulations without prior notice.
The Board may, under emergency circumstances, suspend the operation of a bylaw, policy, or regulation and adopt, revise, or abolish a bylaw, policy, or regulation without prior notice.
The emergency adoption, revision, or abolishment of a bylaw,  policy, or regulation shall terminate at the next meeting of the Board or at such earlier date as may be specified by the Board unless further acted upon by the Board in accordance with this Bylaw.
The adoption, revision, abolishment, or suspension of a bylaw,  policy, or regulation shall be recorded in the minutes of the Board.
Any bylaw, policy, or regulation or part of a bylaw, policy, or regulation that is superseded by a term in a negotiated agreement or by a subsequently adopted bylaw, policy, or regulation shall no longer be in force and effect as a bylaw, policy, or regulation and shall be abolished by the Board in accordance with this Bylaw.
Promulgation and Distribution
The manual of bylaws, policies, and regulations shall be maintained.
A copy of the manual of bylaws, policies, and regulations shall be available and accessible to each Board member, the Superintendent, the School Business Administrator/Board Secretary, the Board Attorney, each Building Principal, and other individuals designated by the Superintendent.
The Superintendent or Designee shall institute a plan for the orderly promulgation of policies to staff members who are affected by them and shall provide staff members with access to an up-to-date manual of Board bylaws, policies, and regulations.
The manual of bylaws, policies, and regulations shall be considered a public record open to inspection in the office of the Superintendent.
The manual retained by the Superintendent shall be considered the master copy of the manual
Consideration of Bylaws, Policies, and Regulations
Bylaws, policies, and regulations will be considered for adoption by the Board in accordance with the following procedure:
1.
A recommendation for a new or revised bylaw, policy, or regulation shall be recommended to the Board and/or Superintendent;
2.
A recommendation for a new or revised bylaw, policy, or regulation may be referred, at the discretion of the Board President and as appropriate to the subject, to the Superintendent, a Board committee, or a public advisory committee for study and formulation of a recommendation to the Board.
Any study of a new or revised recommended bylaw, policy, or regulation will consider whether the matter is adequately addressed in existing Board bylaw, policy, or regulation;
3.
If a recommendation for a new or revised bylaw, policy, or regulation results from referral for study, a proposed draft will be referred to the Superintendent and at the discretion of the Board President and as appropriate to the subject, to a Board committee; 
4.
All proposed new and revised bylaws, policies, and regulations shall be submitted to the Superintendent.
The Superintendent or designee will review all new and revised draft bylaws, policies, and regulations prior to the Board receiving a draft of new or revised bylaws, policies, or regulations for Board consideration;
5.
The proposed draft bylaw, policy, or regulation approved by the Board on first reading, will be submitted for adoption at a succeeding meeting of the Board.
Revisions in the draft may be made at any meeting prior to adoption by a simple majority vote of the Board.
A revision at any succeeding meeting that alters the substantive meaning of the draft will constitute a new first reading, and the draft must be presented for adoption at a succeeding Board meeting.
A change that is merely editorial may be followed by a vote to adopt the new or revised bylaw,  policy, or regulation on second reading.
