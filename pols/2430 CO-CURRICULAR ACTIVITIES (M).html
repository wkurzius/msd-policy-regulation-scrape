Section: Program

Date Edited: October 2009
M
The Board of Education believes that the goals and objectives of this district are best achieved by a diversity of learning experiences, some of which are more appropriately conducted outside the regular instructional program of the school.
The purpose of such co-curricular activities shall be to develop leadership capacities and good organizational skills, to aid in the socialization of pupils, and to enable pupils to explore a wider range of individual interests than might be available in the regular curricular program.
The Board shall make school facilities, supplies, and equipment available and assign staff members for the support of a program of co-curricular activities for pupils in grades Kindergarten through twelve.
The Board shall maintain the program of co-curricular activities at no cost to participating pupils, except that pupils may be required to provide supplies in accordance with Board Policy No.
2520 on instructional supplies and pupils may be required to assume all or part of the costs of travel and attendance at co-curricular events and trips.
For purposes of this policy, co-curricular activities are those activities conducted on or off school premises by clubs, associations, and organizations of pupils sponsored by the Board and do not include athletic competitions and practices.
Co-curricular activities are generally outside of the curriculum and support the curriculum.
However, at the high school level several activities have been given curricular status and are described in the Course Selection Catalogue every year.
No co-curricular activity shall be considered to be under the sponsorship of this Board unless the Superintendent has approved them.
Co-curricular activities include, but need not be limited to the following organizations:  student government, clubs, yearbook and other publication staffs, service organizations and all other co-curricular activities that require a coach or advisor but are not a part of the curricular offerings.
The Board will permit the use of school facilities by organizations of pupils during pupil activity periods.
No group of pupils, regardless of the size of the group, will be denied an opportunity to meet on the basis of the religious, political, philosophical, or other content of the speech at their meeting.
Pupils shall be fully informed of the co-curricular activities available to them and of the eligibility standards established for participation in co-curricular activities.
Co-curricular activities shall be available to all pupils who voluntarily elect to participate except that where eligibility requirements specific to an organization are necessary or desirable, the Board shall be so informed and must approve the establishment of such eligibility standards before they may be operable.
All members of each club/activity will attend scheduled meetings.
All medically excused pupils are required to report to their club/activity if they are in school that day.
If three meetings are missed without being excused by the advisor, then pupil is removed from the club/activity.
If pupil is tardy to club/activity three times without being excused from the advisor, he/she will be removed from club/activity.
The advisor will call the parent(s) or legal guardian(s) when the pupil is in jeopardy of being removed from the club/activity.
If circumstances arise whereby the pupil cannot attend a meeting, the advisor must be notified prior to the meeting missed by personal contact, phone call, or written statement from the parent(s) or legal guardian(s).
Any pupil who fails to appear for a meeting or event, fails to make scheduled individual meetings, or fails to attend school on the activity day will not be allowed to participate in the activity and will be disciplined as determined by the advisor and the administration.
All pupils participating in club/activities are reminded that they are required to attend activities during the fall, winter and school breaks (Thanksgiving, Winter and Spring Break).
Excessive absences from practice, games/events or meetings may be cause from removal from the sport or activity.
All pupils are required to attend classes regularly.
Pupils delinquent in class attendance are subject to disciplinary action.
Lack of attendance in classes may result in failure of class work, resulting in ineligibility in athletics/co-curricular activities.
Pupils who have credit withdrawn due to cuts or excessive absences will be placed on probation pending an appeal.
Appeals must be submitted no later than ten days from notification of credit withdrawal.
The Board will not permit the organization of a fraternity, sorority, or secret society.
