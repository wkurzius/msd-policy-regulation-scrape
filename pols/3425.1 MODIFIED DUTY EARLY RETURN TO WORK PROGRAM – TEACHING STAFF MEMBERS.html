3425.1  - MODIFIED DUTY EARLY RETURN TO WORK PROGRAM – TEACHING STAFF MEMBERS
Section: Teaching Staff Members
Date Created: October 2009
Date Edited: October 2009
New Jersey’s workers' compensation laws provide lost wages and pay medical expenses for an employee who sustains an injury as a result of an on-the-job accident, injury, or occupational disease.
Workers' compensation is designed to protect school district employees and their families against the hardships from injury arising in the workplace.
In an effort to assist school staff in recovering from an eligible workers’ compensation injury, the Board provides a Modified Duty Early Return To Work Program.
The Program is provided to staff members who have been injured on the job, but who are not permanently disabled.
The Program is intended to minimize the negative psychological impact to an injured staff member due to being out of work and to provide a transition and adjustment period for the injured staff member to return to work while recovering from an on-the-job injury.
The school district may assign temporary modified duties and responsibilities to staff members that have sustained an eligible workers’ compensation injury.
These employees may temporarily perform duties and responsibilities that may or may not be within their job description, or may or may not be within their department.
The modified duties and/or responsibilities will be within the injured staff member’s capabilities and a staff member will not be assigned any modified duties and/or responsibilities that require any certifications/licenses that are not possessed by the injured staff member.
The modified duties and responsibilities will be determined by the School Business Administrator/Board Secretary, the district’s designated Workers’ Compensation Coordinator, after a medical examination and evaluation of the injured staff member by the Board’s designated workers’ compensation physician.
The Workers’ Compensation Coordinator will determine if the injured staff member is eligible for modified duties or responsibilities.
This determination will be based on:
1.
The workers’ compensation physician’s examination and evaluation report;
2.
The injured staff member’s capabilities to assume modified duties or responsibilities;
3.
The availability of modified duties and responsibilities within the district at the time; and/or
4.
Other issues that may impact the district’s ability to assign modified duties and responsibilities.
This Modified Duty Early Return to Work Program will be administered consistent with applicable federal and State laws and in accordance with provisions of collective bargaining agreements within the district.
