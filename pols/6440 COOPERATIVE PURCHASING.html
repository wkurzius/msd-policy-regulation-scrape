6440 - COOPERATIVE PURCHASING
Section: Finances
Date Created: October 2009
Date Edited: December 2020
The Board of Education recognizes that centralized, cooperative purchasing may maximize the value received for each dollar spent.
The Board of Education is encouraged to seek savings that may accrue to the school district by means of joint agreements for the purchase of goods or services with the governing body of any municipality or county.
For the purpose of this Policy, “cooperative pricing system” means is a purchasing system in which the lead agency advertises for bids, awards a master contract to the vendor providing for its own quantities and the estimated quantities submitted by the individual registered.
For the purpose of this Policy, “cooperative purchasing system” means a cooperative pricing system, joint purchasing system, commodity resale system, county cooperative contract purchasing system, or regional cooperative pricing system which has been approved and registered subject to N.J.A.C.
5:34-7.1 et seq.
For the purpose of this Policy, “electronic data processing” means the storage, retrieval, combination, or collation of items of information by means of electronic equipment involving the translation of words, numbers, and other symbolic elements into electrical impulses or currents.
For the purpose of this Policy, “joint purchasing system” means a cooperative purchasing system in which the lead agency serves as the purchasing agent for the membership of the system with all of the duties and responsibilities attendant.
The lead agency advertises for bids and awards a single contract to a vendor providing for the payment to the contractor for its own needs and for the needs of the participating registered members of the system.
The only contractual relationship is between the lead agency and the vendor.
For the purpose of this Policy, “lead agency” means the contracting unit which is responsible for the management of the cooperative purchasing system.
For the purpose of this Policy, “registered members” means Boards of Education who have been approved by the Director of the New Jersey Department of Community Affairs for participation in the cooperative purchasing system.
When the lead agency is a Board of Education or Educational Service Commission and the entire membership of the cooperative purchasing system established and properly registered with the New Jersey Division of Local Government Services in the Department of Community Affairs are Boards of Education, the provision and performance of goods or services shall be conducted pursuant to the Public Schools Contract Law.
(N.J.S.A.
18A:18A-11 et seq.)
The School Business Administrator/Board Secretary is hereby authorized to negotiate such joint agreements for goods and services which the Board may determine to be required and which the Board may otherwise lawfully purchase for itself with such approved contracting units as may be appropriate in accordance with State law, the policies of this Board, and the dictates of sound purchasing procedures.

Board of Education, municipality or county, and such other matters deemed necessary to carry out the purposes of the agreement.
Agreements for cooperative and joint purchasing will be subject to all bidding requirements imposed by law.
Purchases made through the State Treasury Department may be made without bid.
Each participant’s share of expenditures for purchases under any such agreement shall be appropriated and paid in the manner set forth in the agreement and in the same manner as for other expenses of the participant.

A contract or lease to provide electronic data processing services shall set forth the charge for all services provided, or in the case of a joint undertaking the proportion of the cost each party thereto shall assume and specify all the details of the management of the joint undertaking, and any other matters that may be deemed necessary for insertion therein, and may be amended from time to time by the contracting parties in accordance with N.J.S.A.
