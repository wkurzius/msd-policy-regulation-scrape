5460.02 - BRIDGE YEAR PILOT PROGRAM
Section: Students
Date Created: October 2021
Date Edited: September 2021
M
The New Jersey Commissioner of Education has established a three-year "Bridge Year Pilot Program," under which each school district with a high school shall offer students in the graduating classes of 2021 and 2022 the opportunity to pursue a Bridge Year during the year immediately following their senior year of high school, in accordance with the provisions of P.L.
2020 c.41.
The purpose of the Bridge Year Pilot Program shall be to provide participating students an additional year to address learning loss and missed opportunities in extracurricular activities, including spring sports programs, as a result of the public health state of emergency caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.
For the purpose of this Policy, "host high school" means the high school that a student, who pursues a Bridge Year pursuant to the provisions of P.L.
2020 c.41, attended as a junior in high school.
Under the Bridge Year Pilot Program, each high school in a school district shall designate a school staff member as a Bridge Year Liaison to serve as the school's central point of contact for students interested in pursuing a Bridge Year and for students participating in a Bridge Year.
Nothing in P.L.
2020 c.41 shall be construed to require a school district to hire an individual to serve as a Bridge Year Liaison.
To be eligible to participate in the Bridge Year Pilot Program, a student shall be nineteen years of age or younger and shall not turn twenty years of age at any time during the Bridge Year, except that a classified student shall be eligible to participate if the student will turn twenty years of age during the Bridge Year due to services provided pursuant to the student's individualized education program.
To participate in the Bridge Year Pilot Program, eligible students must notify their host high school’s Bridge Year Liaison by February 15 of their senior year.
The Bridge Year Liaison shall develop, in consultation with Bridge Year students, an Individual Learning Plan (ILP) for each student.
To ensure ample time to plan for the implementation of services outlined in the ILP, each Bridge Year student’s ILP shall be completed by May 15, but no later than June 1 of the student’s senior year.
During the fall semester of the student's Bridge Year, the student shall take between nine and twelve credits at the host high school, the county college that serves the county of the host high school, or a combination thereof.
During the spring semester of the student’s Bridge Year, the student shall take between nine and twelve credits at the county college that serves the county of the host high school.
During either semester of the Bridge Year, a student may also take up to three credits offered by a four-year institution of higher education at any high school in the State or at any other location to fulfill the student's credit requirement.
At the conclusion of each semester of the Bridge Year, the host high school shall update the student's high school transcript to reflect any high school credits earned during the Bridge Year.
In the event that a student initially decides to pursue a Bridge Year in the fall semester, but does not continue the Bridge Year in the spring semester, the student's host high school shall release all final transcripts and other records as necessary and as may be requested.
A student who decides not to continue the Bridge Year in the spring semester shall not be eligible to participate in a spring sports program or extracurricular activities pursuant to P.L.
2020 c.41.
The State Board of Education shall promulgate regulations pursuant to the "Administrative Procedure Act," P.L.1968, c.410 (C.52:14B -1 et seq.), necessary to effectuate the provisions of P.L.
2020 c.41.
The Higher Education Student Assistance Authority shall promulgate regulations, pursuant to the "Administrative Procedure Act," P.L.1968, c.410 (C.52:14B -1    et seq.), necessary to effectuate the provisions of subsection d.
of section 2 of this Act.
