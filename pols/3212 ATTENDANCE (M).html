3212 - ATTENDANCE (M)
Section: Teaching Staff Members
Date Created: October 2009
Date Edited: June 2024
M
The regular and prompt attendance of teaching staff members is an essential element in the efficient operation of the school district and the educational program.
Teaching staff member absenteeism disrupts the educational program and the Board of Education considers attendance an important component of a teaching staff member’s job performance.
Teaching staff members shall provide notice for the use of sick time as required in N.J.S.A.
18A:30-4 and Policy and Regulation 1642.01 in accordance with the district’s procedure for teaching staff members to report the use of sick leave and other absences.
A teaching staff member who fails to give prompt notice of an absence, misuses sick leave, fails to verify an absence in accordance with statute, administrative code, or Board policy; falsifies the reason for an absence; is absent without authorization: is repeatedly tardy; or accumulates an excessive number of absences may be subject to appropriate consequences, which may include, but not be limited to, the withholding of a salary increment, termination, nonrenewal, and/or certification of tenure charges.
Sick leave is defined in accordance with N.J.S.A.
18A:30-1 and Policy and Regulation 1642.01.
No teaching staff member will be discouraged from the prudent, necessary use of sick leave and any other leave provided for by statute; administrative code; collective bargaining agreement; an individual employment contract; or the policies of the Board.
The Superintendent or Board of Education may require verification to be filed with the Secretary of the Board in order to obtain sick leave in accordance with the provisions of N.J.S.A.
18A:30-4 and Policy and Regulation 1642.01.
The Superintendent, in consultation with administrative staff members, will review the rate of absence among teaching staff members.
The review will include the collection and analysis of attendance patterns, the training of teaching staff members in their attendance responsibilities, and the counseling of teaching staff members for whom regular and prompt attendance is a problem.
