3212 - ATTENDANCE (M)
Section: Teaching Staff Members
Date Created: October 2009
Date Edited: October 2009
M
The regular and prompt attendance of teaching staff members is an essential element in the efficient operation of the school district and the effective conduct of the educational program.
Because absenteeism exacts a high cost in the depletion of district resources and in the disruption of the educational program, the Board of Education is vitally interested in the attendance of each employee and considers conscientious attendance an important criterion of satisfactory job performance.
The privilege of district employment imposes on each teaching staff member the responsibility to be on the job on time every scheduled working day.
This responsibility requires that the employee maintain good health standards, take intelligent precautions against accidents, both on and off the job, and manage his/her personal affairs to avoid conflict with district responsibilities.
A teaching staff member who fails to give prompt notice of an absence, misuses sick leave, fails to verify an absence in accordance with Board policy, falsifies the reason for an absence, is absent without authorization, is repeatedly tardy, or accumulates an excessive number of absences without good cause may be subject to discipline, which may include the withholding of one or subsequent salary increments and/or certification of tenure charges.
No teaching staff member will be discouraged from the prudent, necessary use of sick leave and any other leave provided for in the contract negotiated with the member's majority representative or provided in the policies of the Board.
The Superintendent is directed to ascertain the rate of absence among the professional staff, in accordance with rules of the State Board of Education.
Whenever the rate of absence in any school year is higher than three and one-half percent, the Superintendent shall develop and present to the Board a plan for the review and improvement of staff attendance.
The review and improvement plan shall require the collection and analysis of attendance data, the training of teaching staff members in their attendance responsibilities, and the counseling of teaching staff members for whom regular and prompt attendance is a problem.
