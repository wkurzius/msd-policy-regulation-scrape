7520 - LOAN OF SCHOOL EQUIPMENT
Section: Property
Date Created: October 2009
Date Edited: October 2009
The Board of Education believes that district owned equipment is a valuable resource that may be loaned for community use under certain conditions and when such use does not interfere with the educational program of the school.
The Board may lend specific items of equipment on the written request of the user when approval has been granted by the Superintendent, School Business Administrator/Board Secretary or Principal and when such equipment is unobtainable elsewhere.
School equipment may be removed from school property by pupils or staff members only when such equipment is necessary to accomplish a task arising from their school or job responsibilities.
The consent of the Principal is required for such removal.
The removal of school equipment from school property by pupils or employees for personal use is prohibited.
Borrowed items must be returned within two weeks.
The user of school owned equipment shall be fully liable for any damage or loss occurring to the equipment during the period of its use, regardless of any assignment of negligence, and shall be responsible for its safe return.
When equipment authorized for loan requires the services of a qualified operator, the user shall employ the services of a person designated by this district and shall pay such costs as may have been set for such services.
Adopted:  20 October 2009
