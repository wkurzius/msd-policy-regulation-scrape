6A:23A-5.3(d) and to comply with all program requirements as set forth in N.J.A.C.

As part of the annual budget information, the Department of Education shall provide each school district with a projection of available SEMI reimbursement for the budget year, as determined by the State Department of Treasury’s third party administrator for SEMI.
Beginning with the 2009-2010 school year, the school district shall recognize as revenue in its annual school district budget no less than ninety percent of the projection provided by the Department of Education.
The district may seek approval from the Executive County Superintendent to use its own projection of SEMI reimbursement upon demonstration that the numbers it used in calculating the projection are more accurate than the projection provided.
The school district shall strive to achieve maximum participation in the SEMI program.
“Maximum participation” means obtaining a ninety percent return rate of parental consent forms for all SEMI eligible pupils.
Districts shall enter all pupils following their evaluations into the third-party system to identify the district’s universe of eligible pupils.
This can be done without parental consent.
Districts participating in the SEMI reimbursement program shall comply with program requirements as outlined in N.J.A.C.

A  school  district that has less than ninety percent participation of SEMI eligible pupils in the prebudget year or that has failed to comply with all program requirements set forth in N.J.A.C.
6A:23A-5.3(e) shall submit a SEMI action plan to the Executive County Superintendent for review and approval as part of the school district’s proposed budget submission.
The district’s SEMI action plan shall include the components as outlined in N.J.A.C.
6A:23A:5.3(g).
Districts that did not achieve ninety percent participation or achieve their approved benchmarks in the SEMI program for a given budget year and cannot demonstrate that they fully implemented their Department of Education approved SEMI action plan, shall be subject to review for the withholding of State aid by the Commissioner pursuant to N.J.S.A.
18A:55-3 in an amount equal to the SEMI revenue projection based on their approved benchmark for the budget year, if applicable, less actual SEMI reimbursements for the budget year.
The State aid deduction shall be made in the second subsequent year after the budget year.
