6115.04 - FEDERAL FUNDS-DUPLICATION OF BENEFITS
Section: Finances
Date Created: September 2023
Date Edited: September 2023
A requirement for a Board of Education/local education agency (LEA) who accepts funds from the Coronavirus Response and Relief Supplemental Appropriations Act (CRRSAA) â€“ Elementary and Secondary School Emergency Relief Fund (ESSERF II); American Rescue Plan Elementary and Secondary Schools Emergency Relief (ARP ESSER); and all Federal programs and grants is for the LEA to have a Duplication of Benefits (DOB) Policy.
DOB occurs when a person, household, business, government, or other entity receives financial assistance from multiple sources for the same purpose, and the total assistance received for that purpose is more than the total need for assistance.
The School Business Administrator/Board Secretary shall be responsible for ensuring no DOB occurs and will be responsible for ensuring compliance by subcontractors, subrecipients, and other partners.
To comply with DOB requirements, an LEA that accepts Federal funds is required by the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act to establish and follow procedures to ensure that DOB does not occur.
Establishing a process to effectively identify and prevent DOB is critical for the LEA to effectively manage multiple active funding streams related to coronavirus response and efficiently target resources to meet unmet needs within the school district.
The Board of Education is solely responsible for ensuring that an actual DOB does not occur.
To prevent DOB, the LEA will have: 
1.
A requirement that the LEA must agree to repay assistance that is determined to be duplicative.
This may be documented through a subrogation agreement or similar clause included in the agreement with the LEA.
The LEA will establish a protocol to monitor compliance based on risk of DOB for each activity; and
2.
A method of assessing whether the use of these funds will duplicate financial assistance that is already received or is likely to be received (such as insurance proceeds) by acting reasonably to evaluate the need and the resources available to meet that need.
The LEA will evaluate current programs available at the local, county, State, and Federal level as well as current and anticipated non-governmental assistance from nonprofits or faith-based groups and establish lines of communication for preventing DOB.
To analyze DOB, the LEA will complete the following steps:
1.
Assess Need:  Determine the amount of need (total cost);
2.
Determine Assistance:  Determine the amount of assistance that has or will be provided from all sources to pay for the cost;
3.
Calculate Unmet Need:  Determine the amount of assistance already provided compared to the need to determine the maximum award (unmet need); and
4.
Document Analysis:  Document calculation and maintain adequate documentation justifying determination of maximum award.
In DOB calculations, private loans are not considered a form of assistance and will not be considered when calculating DOB.
However, subsidized loans from the Small Business Administration or Federal Emergency Management Agency will be included in the DOB analysis unless one of the three exceptions below is met: 
1.
Short-term subsidized loans (e.g.
bridge loans) for costs later reimbursed with Federal funds;
2.
Declined or cancelled subsidized loans; or
3.
Loan assistance used toward a loss suffered as a result of a major disaster or emergency.
Adopted: 08 August 2023
