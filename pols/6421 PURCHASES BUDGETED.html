6421 - PURCHASES BUDGETED
Section: Finances
Date Created: October 2009
Date Edited: October 2009
The Board of Education directs the establishment of procedures for the purchase of budgeted goods and services that will make prudent use of district resources and yield the maximum value for the school district.
The School Business Administrator/Board Secretary shall authorize all purchases that are within a budget line item and are consistent with the purpose for which the funds were appropriated.
No purchase order may be placed until the School Business Administrator/Board Secretary has determined whether the proposed purchase is subject to bid, whether sufficient funds exist in the line item, and whether the goods are available elsewhere in the district.
Whenever the estimated value of a purchase or contract for goods or services other than professional services N.J.S.A.
18A:18A-5(1) and work by employees of the Board N.J.S.A.
18A:18A-5(3) is fifteen percent or more of the bid threshold established in accordance with N.J.S.A.
18A:18A-3 and N.J.S.A.
18A:18A-37 and is not made under a state contract, the purchasing agent shall, whenever practicable, solicit at least two quotations from independent vendors.
All quotations received will be attached to and retained with a copy of the voucher used to pay the vendor.
All contracts that are in the aggregate less than fifteen percent of the bid threshold may be awarded by the School Business Administrator/Board Secretary without soliciting competitive quotations.
The purchase or contract may be awarded on the basis of the lowest responsible quotation received or to the vendor who submits the quotation most advantageous to the Board on the basis of price and other factors.
If it is determined that it is impractical to seek quotations for an extraordinary, unspecifiable service or that the purchase or contract for which quotations were sought should not be awarded on the basis of the lowest quotation received, the reasons for that determination will be set forth in writing and attached to the resulting purchase order or contract.
Supplies commonly used in the various schools will be standardized to the extent that it is educationally feasible to do so.
Alternate suggestions will be made to a requisitioner if better service, delivery, economy, or utility can be achieved by a change in the proposed order.
When a purchase order is placed or a contract entered, the School Business Administrator/Board Secretary or designee shall commit the expenditure against a specific budget line item or project category in order to guard against the creation of liabilities in excess of appropriations.
