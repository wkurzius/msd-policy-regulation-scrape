District Policy
4211 - ATTENDANCE
Section: Support Staff
Date Created: October 2009
Date Edited: October 2009
Employee attendance is an important factor in the successful operation of any school district and in the maintenance of the continuity of the educational program.
The Board of Education is vitally and continually interested in the attendance of each employee and considers satisfactory attendance an important criterion of satisfactory job performance.
The privilege of district employment imposes on each employee the responsibility to be on the job on time every scheduled working day.
This responsibility requires that the employee maintain good health standards, take intelligent precautions against accidents both on and off the job, and manage personal affairs in order to satisfy district attendance requirements.
The Board is required by the high costs of absences and disrupted work schedules to give continuing attention to the maintenance of regular attendance by employees.
Chronic absenteeism and tardiness are subject to discipline and may be cause for dismissal.
The Superintendent shall develop regulations to implement this policy.
