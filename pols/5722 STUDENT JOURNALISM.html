Date Edited: September 2022
M
The Board of Education believes it is important to afford students the opportunity to exercise their creativity, passion, and constitutionally-protected freedom of speech.
However, the Board also believes this opportunity must be balanced between ensuring students have the right to speak freely while also preserving the ability of district staff to maintain the safe and orderly operation of the school district.
The Board adopts this Policy granting students the right to exercise freedom of speech and of the press in accordance with N.J.S.A.
18A:36-44 and N.J.S.A.
18A:36-45.
For the purpose of this Policy, the following terms shall mean:
“Prior restraint” means a school official informing a student journalist(s) the news, opinion, feature, and advertising content of school-sponsored media, subject to the restrictions listed in N.J.S.A.
18A:36-45.b., N.J.S.A.
18A:36-45.c., and the provisions of this Policy, cannot be published in school-sponsored media or a school official takes any action to prevent a student from doing so.
“Prior review” means a school official reviewing school sponsored media before it is published, broadcast by a student journalist at school or distributed, or generally made available to members of the student body.
“School official” means the Principal or designee or an administrative staff member designated by the Superintendent.
“School-sponsored media” means any material that is prepared, substantially written, published, or broadcast by a student journalist at school, distributed or generally made available to members of the student body, and prepared under the direction of a student media advisor.
School-sponsored media does not include media intended for distribution or transmission solely in the classroom in which the media is produced.
“Student journalist” means a student who gathers, compiles, writes, edits, photographs, records, or prepares information for dissemination in                    school-sponsored media.
“Student media advisor” means an individual employed, appointed, or designated by the district to supervise or provide instruction relating to school-sponsored media.
Student journalists have the right to exercise freedom of speech and of the press in school-sponsored media, regardless of whether the media is supported financially by the district or by use of school district facilities, or produced in conjunction with a class in which the student is enrolled.

If the school official cannot show the school-sponsored media is prohibited under N.J.S.A.
18A:36-45.c.
and 1.
through 5.
above, within the three school days, the student journalist may release the school-sponsored media.
When a school official determines the restraint of student expression is necessary, the school official shall simultaneously identify at least one of the five prohibitions listed in 1.
