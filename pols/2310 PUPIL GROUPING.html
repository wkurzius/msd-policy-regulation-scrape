The Board of Education recognizes its responsibility to provide each child with the educational program and facility which will be of maximum benefit to him/her.
The Board, therefore, authorizes the Superintendent to assign each child to the school and grade level which will best meet the needs of the pupil.
The Superintendent is directed to devise such evaluation measures and placement procedures as will insure effective pupil grouping.
When a pupil enters the Manville schools from another district, he/she will be placed in accordance with his/her ability and achievement.
