2110 - PHILOSOPHY OF EDUCATION/DISTRICT MISSION STATEMENT (M)
Section: Program
Date Created: October 2009
Date Edited: October 2009
Free public education for all children is a cornerstone of a democratic society that values the worth and dignity of each individual.
The primary goal of this Board of Education shall be to offer each child in this district the educational opportunity that will enable him/her to function politically, economically, and socially in that democratic society.
The Board, as the agent responsible for the education of the children of the district, will provide a planned program of learning that incorporates into its curriculum the lessons and experiences, within and without the classroom, needed to realize the educational goals of this district.
The Board appreciates the need for constant improvement of the instructional program and will strive unremittingly to provide an educational system that assists each pupil in becoming a self-respecting individual who can function effectively and satisfyingly.
It is the expectation of this school district that all pupils achieve the New Jersey Core Curriculum Content Standards at all grade levels.
The Board will seek out and work cooperatively with the available resources of home and community including business and industry, in the improvement of the educational program.
The Board will endeavor to employ a high caliber, well-prepared staff of adequate size and wide-ranging abilities.
Moreover, the Board will provide pupils and staff, as needs dictate and means permit, with adequate educational supplies, equipment, and facilities.
The purpose of education in the schools of this district is to facilitate the development of each child to his/her greatest potential.
The school staff shall recognize individual differences among pupils and encourage their achievement and progress, not only in basic skills but in the ability to think independently and critically.
The school staff shall help pupils to understand our democratic society; to believe in it and to act fairly in their relationships with others; to develop in themselves attitudes of respect and helpfulness toward others; to want, and to be able to perform well, some portion of the work of the world; to acquire knowledge and skills necessary to do this with satisfaction to themselves and society; to understand and use effective methods in framing the questions and tackling the problems that they encounter in their lives to the end that they may function politically, economically, and socially in a democratic society.
