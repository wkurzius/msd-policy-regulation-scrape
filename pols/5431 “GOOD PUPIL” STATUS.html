5431 - “GOOD PUPIL” STATUS
Section: Students
Date Created: October 2009
Date Edited: October 2009
The Board of Education authorizes the release, on the request of a pupil or a pupil's parent(s) or legal guardian(s), of such information regarding a pupil's grades as may be required to secure a "good pupil" discount on the cost of automobile liability insurance.
Where the insurer has established no standard for determining the achievement level on which the discount is contingent, the Board directs that a pupil has acquired a "good pupil" status if his/her grade average is equal to or higher than the grade average of the pupil's class during the immediately preceding semester.
