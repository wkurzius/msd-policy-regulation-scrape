2431.3 - PRACTICE AND PRE-SEASON HEAT-ACCLIMATION FOR INTERSCHOLASTIC ATHLETICS/ACTIVITIES
Section: Program
Date Created: April 2012
Date Edited: April 2012
The Board of Education adopts this Policy as a measure to protect the safety, health and welfare of pupils participating in school-sponsored interscholastic athletic programs.
The Board believes practice and pre-season heat-acclimation guidelines for student-athletes will minimize injury and enhance the student-athlete's health, performance, and well-being.
For the purposes of this Policy, “practice time,” means the time a player engages in physical activity.
Warm-up, stretching, conditioning, weight training, and “cool-down” periods shall be calculated in practice time.
For the purposes of this Policy “walk-through” means practice time where no protective equipment or strenuous activity is permitted and only balls and field markers (cones) may be used.
The first five days of the Board approved pre-season practice shall consist of no more than three hours of practice time.
This three-hour practice time during the first five days may be divided into multiple sessions, but total practice time shall not exceed three hours.
Full protective gear required for any athletic program may only be worn by student-athletes on the third day of practice and thereafter.
Activities during the first two days of practice will be limited to those activities where full protective gear is not needed or required.
Protective headgear may be worn on the first two days.
Full equipment shall not be worn for any practice that is held before the NJSIAA official start of practice date.
A student-athlete shall not be permitted to participate in a scrimmage for any sport until he/she has completed six complete days of practice.
An athletic team may not practice for more than six consecutive days and one twenty-four hour rest period must be included within a seven-day period.
After the fifth day of practice, the maximum allotted time per day for practice shall not exceed five hours.
The five-hour practice time may be divided into multiple sessions but total practice time in any day shall not exceed five hours.
A five-hour practice day may not be followed by a practice day greater than three hours.
Therefore, practice  days  may  follow  a  3-5-3-5 format.
A minimum of a three-hour recovery period shall be provided after any session of greater than two hours in length and a three-hour recovery period should be provided before a walk-through.
The Superintendent of Schools may reduce the practice times in this Policy in the event the weather and/or temperature warrants such action.
This Policy shall be approved by the school district’s physician prior to Board of Education approval.
