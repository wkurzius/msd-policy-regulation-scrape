5466 - GRADUATION AND YEARBOOK FEES (M)
Section: Students
Date Created: October 2009
Date Edited: October 2009
M
The Board of Education recognizes that the cost of graduation ceremonies, if any, directly paid by graduating pupils and the cost of a yearbook directly paid by the graduating pupil may create a financial hardship for the parent(s), legal guardian(s) or other person having legal custody of the graduating pupil.
The Board of Education will not exclude from the graduation ceremony any pupil who is unable to pay the fees required of the graduating pupil to participate in the graduation ceremony because of financial hardship for the parent(s), legal guardian(s) or other person having legal custody of the graduating pupil.
Furthermore, the Board will pay the cost for a graduating pupil to purchase a yearbook if the graduating pupil is unable to pay the fees required of the graduating pupil to participate in the graduation ceremony because of financial hardship for the parent(s), legal guardian(s) or other person having legal custody of the graduating pupil.
In determining financial hardship, the criteria will be the same as the Statewide eligibility standards established by the State Board of Education for free and reduced price meals under the State School Lunch Program.
