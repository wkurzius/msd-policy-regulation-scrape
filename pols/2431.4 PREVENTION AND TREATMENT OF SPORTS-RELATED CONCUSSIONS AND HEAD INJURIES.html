2431.4 - PREVENTION AND TREATMENT OF SPORTS-RELATED CONCUSSIONS AND HEAD INJURIES 
Section: Program
Date Created: September 2011
Date Edited: July 2024
M
A concussion is a traumatic brain injury caused by a blow or motion to the head or body that disrupts the normal functioning of the brain and can cause significant and sustained neuropsychological impairments including, but not limited to, problem solving, planning, memory, and behavioral problems.
In order to ensure safety, it is imperative that student-athletes participating in a program of athletic competition, coaches, and parents are educated about the nature and treatment of sports-related concussions and other head injuries.
Allowing a student-athlete to return to a program of athletic competition before recovering from a concussion increases the chance of a more serious brain injury.
This Policy and Regulation 2431.4 are consistent with the requirements of N.J.S.A.
18A:40-41.1 et seq., the New Jersey Department of Education Model Policy and Guidance for Districts on the Prevention and Treatment of Sports-Related Head Injuries and Concussions, and the recommendations developed by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

For the purpose of this Policy and Regulation 2431.4, “student-athlete” shall mean any student enrolled in a public or nonpublic school in New Jersey who is a participant in a program of athletic competition organized by the school district.

School staff members supervising programs of athletic competition; licensed athletic trainers; nurses; and school/team physicians shall be trained on the possible signs or symptoms of a concussion.
Any possible signs or symptoms of a concussion shall be reported by the student-athlete or an observer to the staff member supervising the program of athletic competition; athletic trainer; school/team physician; school nurse; and/or parent.
The district will adopt an Interscholastic Head Injury Training Program to be completed by the school/team physician, licensed athletic trainer, coaches, and other appropriate district personnel pursuant to N.J.S.A.

The student-athlete’s written medical clearance shall be reviewed and approved by the school physician.
School personnel shall contact the parent of a student-athlete to inform them of a suspected sports-related concussion or head injury as soon as possible after the incident.
