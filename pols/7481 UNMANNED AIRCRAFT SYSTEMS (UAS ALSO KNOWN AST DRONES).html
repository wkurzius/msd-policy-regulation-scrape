Section: Property
Date Created: July 2017
Date Edited: May 2017
The Board of Education is concerned for the safety of all staff members, students, parents, community members, and visitors while on school grounds.
The Board of Education recognizes the operation of an unmanned aircraft system (UAS) on school grounds or flying an unmanned aircraft on or over school grounds presents a public safety issue as school grounds are populated many hours of the day by students, staff members, parents, and community members.
An unmanned aircraft system is the unmanned aircraft and all the associated support equipment, control station, data links, telemetry, communications and navigation equipment, etc.
necessary to operate the unmanned aircraft.
The unmanned aircraft is the flying portion of the system by a pilot via a ground control system, or autonomously through the use of an on-board computer, communication links and any additional equipment that is necessary for the unmanned aircraft to operate safely.
A model aircraft is considered an unmanned aircraft.
The Board of Education prohibits the operation of an unmanned aircraft system on school grounds, the launching or landing of an unmanned aircraft on school grounds, or the flying of an unmanned aircraft over school grounds at all times.
The Board of Education will post signage on all school grounds indicating that the operation of an unmanned aircraft system or flying an unmanned aircraft over school grounds is prohibited at all times.
The Board of Education will take appropriate action in accordance with Federal Aviation Administration regulations and/or any State and local laws against any violations of the provisions of this Policy.
