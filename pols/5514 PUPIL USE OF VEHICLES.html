Section: Students

The Board of Education regards the operation by pupils of any vehicle for transportation to and from school as a matter subject to Board authority because pupil safety is of paramount concern to the Board.
The Board will permit the use of motor vehicles by pupils in accordance with district rules provided that such pupils present written parental approval, have been granted permission by the Building Principal to operate a motor vehicle on school grounds, possess a valid New Jersey driver's license, and have successfully completed a course in driver education.
The Board will permit the use of bicycles by pupils in accordance with district rules provided such pupils present written parental approval, have been granted permission by the Building Principal.
The Superintendent shall develop and disseminate regulations for the operation and parking of vehicles on school grounds.
Permission to operate a vehicle on school grounds may be revoked for a pupil's failure to observe rules.
The Board will not be responsible for any vehicle that is lost, stolen, or damaged.
