The Board of Education shall, in accordance with law or employee authorization, make deductions from an employee's paycheck and remit the amounts deducted to the agent designated by the employee.
Deductions will routinely be made as required for federal income tax, social security and medicare; New Jersey income tax, unemployment assistance, and other miscellaneous taxes; and by the New Jersey Division of Pensions.
Deductions may also be made, provided they have been duly authorized by the employee in writing, for contributions on the employee's behalf for:

Contributions shall be made as soon as is reasonably possible after the funds have been deducted from an employee's salary.
No contribution shall be made on behalf of an employee until the amount contributed has been deducted from the employee's salary.
No more than three accounts will be approved for remittance at any one time.
An employee who wishes to pay into a tax sheltered annuity or mutual fund offered by a firm not approved by this Board for payroll deductions must make his/her payment individually.
No Board employee shall withhold or pay to another or purchase or have assigned, other than by court order, any compensation for the services rendered by an employee of this district.
