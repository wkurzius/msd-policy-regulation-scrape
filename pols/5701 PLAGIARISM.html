This means that they will not engage in any of the following acts:

Cheating on examinations, including but not limited to, the non-authorized use of books or notes, the use of crib sheets, copying from other pupils’ papers, exchanging information with other pupils orally, in writing, or by signals, obtaining copies of the examination illegally and other similar activities.
2.
Plagiarism is not permitted in term papers, themes, essays, reports, images, take-home examinations, and other academic work.
Plagiarism is defined as stealing or use without acknowledgment of the ideas, words, formulas, textual materials, on line services, computer programs, etc.
of another person, or in any way presenting the work of another person as one’s own.
3.
Falsifications, including forging signatures, altering answers after they have been graded, the insertion of answers after the fact, the erasure of grader’s markings, and other acts that allow for falsely taking credit.
B.
A pupil found guilty of academic dishonesty may be subjected to a full range of penalties including, but not limited to, reprimand and loss of credit for all of the work that is plagiarized.
C.
A teacher who believes that a pupil has been academically dishonest in his/her class should resolve the matter in the following manner:
1.
Reprimand the pupil orally and/or in writing.
The teacher is also authorized to withhold credit in the work tainted by the academic dishonesty.
2.
If warranted, the teacher shall file a written complaint against the pupil with the Principal, requesting a more stringent form of discipline.
The complaint must describe in detail the academic dishonesty that is alleged to have taken place, and must request that the matter be reviewed by the Principal.
3.
The Principal will determine if further discipline of the pupil is appropriate, and will determine the nature of the discipline on a case-by-case basis.
4.
If the pupil is not in agreement with the disciplinary action of the Principal, he/she may appeal the action to the Superintendent.
If the pupil is dissatisfied with the Superintendent’s disposition of the case, he/she may grieve the action in accordance with Policy No.
