Section: Finances
Date Created: October 2009
Date Edited: October 2009
The Board of Education directs the establishment and conduct of bidding procedures that serve the public interest and provide each qualified vendor an equal opportunity to furnish goods and services to the district.
Every contract for the performance of work or the purchase or lease of materials or supplies not exempted by law will be subject to public bidding whenever the aggregate value of such a contract within one contract year exceeds the bid threshold established by law and in accordance with N.J.S.A.
18A:18A-3.(a).
Whenever possible, purchases will be aggregated; purchases may not intentionally be divided to avoid the requirements for competitive bidding as required in N.J.S.A.
18A:18A-8.
The purchase of textbooks and materials that exceed the bid threshold and are approved by the Board pursuant to N.J.S.A.
18A:34-1 shall not require the further adoption of a resolution for purchase.
Bid specifications will be prepared and/or are coordinated by the School Business Administrator/Board Secretary.
Each bid specification will offer a common standard of competition and will assert the Boardâ€™s right to accept reasonable equivalents and to reject all bids and readvertise.
The School Business Administrator/Board Secretary is authorized to advertise for bids in accordance with N.J.S.A.
18A:18A-21 without the prior approval of the Board, but shall inform the Board of any such advertisement at the Board meeting next following.
Records of advertisements will be kept in detail sufficient to show that a reasonable number of qualified vendors were invited to bid.
Bids shall be opened publicly by the School Business Administrator/Board Secretary or designee before one or more witnesses at a previously designated time and place.
Contracts will be awarded, on a resolution duly adopted by the Board, to the lowest responsible bidder who submits the lowest responsible bid, except that the Board may choose to reject all bids, to readvertise, or to purchase under a State contract.
The Board may disqualify a bidder who would otherwise be determined to be the lowest responsible bidder in accordance with N.J.S.A.
18A:18A-4.
Whenever two or more bids are the lowest bids submitted by responsible bidders, the Board shall determine to which bidder the contract will be awarded.
The bid of a vendor who claims, before bids are opened, a mistake or omission in its preparation will be returned unopened.
A bidder who discovers a mistake or omission after bids have been opened may withdraw the erroneous bid provided he or she gives immediate written notice of the mistake or omission and certification, supported by clear evidence, that he or she exercised reasonable care in the examination of the specifications and preparation of the bid.
Any bidder who withdraws an opened bid shall forfeit any bid security deposited with the bid in accordance with law.
In accordance with the provisions of N.J.A.C.
6A:23A-5.4, pursuant to the authority granted the Commissioner of Education under N.J.S.A.
18A:55-2 and N.J.S.A.
18A:7F-60, the Commissioner shall subject to review for the withholding of State funds any school district that fails to obey the provisions of the Public Contract law, N.J.S.A.
18A:18A-1 et seq.
The amount of funds to be withheld shall equal the amount of the contract awarded in violation of the provisions of N.J.S.A.
18A:18A-1 et seq.
except for violations related to the award of contracts under the extraordinary unspecifiable services (EUS) provision which shall be governed by the provisions of N.J.S.A.
18A:18A-46.1.
N.J.S.A.
18A:18A-1 et seq.
N.J.A.C.
6A:23A-5.4; 6A:27-9.1 et seq.
Adopted:  20 October 2009
