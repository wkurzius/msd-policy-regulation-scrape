The Board of Education recognizes electronic communications and the use of social media outlets create new options for extending and enhancing the educational program of the school district.
Electronic communications and the use of social media can help students and teaching staff members communicate regarding:  questions during non-school hours regarding homework or other assignments; scheduling issues for school-related co-curricular and interscholastic athletic activities; school work to be completed during a student’s extended absence; distance learning opportunities; and other professional communications that can enhance teaching and learning opportunities between teaching staff members and students.
