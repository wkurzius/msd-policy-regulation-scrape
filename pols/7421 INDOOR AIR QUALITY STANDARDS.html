7421 - INDOOR AIR QUALITY STANDARDS
Section: Property
Date Created: October 2009
Date Edited: October 2009
The Board of Education will provide air quality for school employees in school buildings that meet the standards established by the New Jersey Department of Labor pursuant to N.J.A.C.
12:100-13.
The Board will designate the Supervisor of Buildings and Grounds as the individual, who is responsible to assure compliance with New Jersey Department of Labor standards.
The designated person will assure that preventative maintenance programs for heating, ventilating and air conditioning (HVAC) systems are implemented and documented and that general and local exhaust ventilation is used for employees working with equipment or products that could reasonably be expected to result in hazardous chemicals or particulate exposure.
The designated person shall check to make sure HVAC systems are working properly when the building temperatures are outside of the range of 68 to 79 degrees Fahrenheit and make sure buildings without mechanical ventilation have operable windows, doors, vents, stacks and other portals designated or used for natural ventilation are operational.
The designated person will also promptly investigate all employee complaints of signs or symptoms that may be associated with building-related illnesses.
The Board will make sure air quality will be maintained at acceptable standards during renovation and remodeling that results in the diffusion of dust, stone and other small particles, toxic gases or other harmful substances in quantities hazardous to health.
The designated person will notify employees at least twenty-four hours in advance, or promptly in emergency situations of work to be performed on the building that may induce air contaminants into their work area.
The designated person will respond to a complaint received by the Department of Labor within fifteen working days of receipt of the complaint.
