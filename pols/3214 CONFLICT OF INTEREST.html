3214 - CONFLICT OF INTEREST
Section: Teaching Staff Members
Date Created: October 2009
Date Edited: October 2009
No teaching staff member of the Board of Education shall have any interest, financial or otherwise, direct or indirect, or engage in any business or transaction or professional activity which is in conflict with the proper discharge of the teaching staff memberâ€™s duties.
No teaching staff member shall use or attempt to use his/her position to secure unwarranted privileges or advantages.
No teaching staff member of the Board shall act in his/her official capacity in any matter wherein he/she has a direct or indirect personal financial interest.
No teaching staff member of the Board shall accept any gift, favor, service or other thing of value under circumstances from which it might be reasonably inferred that such gift, service or other thing of value was given or offered for the purpose of influencing the teaching staff member in the discharge of his/her duties.
The Board of Education discourages the presentation of gifts to teaching staff members by pupils and their parent(s) or legal guardian(s), because it may embarrass pupils with limited means and give the appearance of currying favor.
The Board directs that teaching staff members instruct their pupils to express their appreciation by means other than gifts.
Teaching staff members may receive gifts of only nominal value from pupils or their parent(s) or legal guardian(s).
The Superintendent may approve an act or gift of appreciation to an individual teaching staff member when special circumstances warrant.
