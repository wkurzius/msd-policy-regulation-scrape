The district shall administer to each student enrolled in the district the Statewide home-language survey (HLS) to determine which students in preschool to twelfth-grade have a primary language(s) other than English and, therefore, may be a ML.

Preschool students who are identified as having a primary language other than English shall be identified as MLs.
Prior to the start of their Kindergarten year, the district shall administer an ELP assessment to preschool MLs as part of the screener process to determine the ML’s English language proficiency level.
