Section: Community
Date Created: October 2009
Date Edited: March 2012
The Board of Education recognizes the services of volunteers can enrich the educational program, assist teaching staff members in the performance of their duties, and enhance the relationship between the school district and the community.
The Board authorizes a program for the utilization of volunteer services in grades Kindergarten through 12 in the schools of the school district.
An unpaid volunteer is not required to complete a criminal 
history record check.
For the purpose of this Policy, a “volunteer” is a person who is not paid by the Board of Education, who assists with classroom or other school activities under the direct supervision of an appropriately certified or licensed school district employee, and provides assistance for school activities on a “regular basis” throughout the school year.
For the purpose of this Policy, “regular basis” means volunteering services on a consistent and scheduled timeframe during the school year.
For the purpose of this Policy, a “volunteer” is not a person who is invited into a school and provides occasional assistance for school activities, chaperones a class trip, or assists with classroom or other school activities.
The Superintendent or designee shall determine if a person meets or will meet the requirements to be a “volunteer” for the purpose of this Policy.
A volunteer must be approved by the Board upon the recommendation of the Superintendent.
The Principal or designee shall be responsible for the recruitment and screening of volunteers, may delegate the assignment of volunteers to specific tasks, and must submit their names for Board approval.
Volunteers must be persons of known character, responsibility, and integrity
Neither the Superintendent nor any Principal shall be obligated to utilize the proffered services of a volunteer whose abilities or interests do not serve the needs of pupils.
