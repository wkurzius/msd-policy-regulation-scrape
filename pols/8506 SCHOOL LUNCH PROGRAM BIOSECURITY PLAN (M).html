8506 - SCHOOL LUNCH PROGRAM BIOSECURITY PLAN (M)
Section: Operations
Date Created: October 2009
Date Edited: October 2009
M
The Board of Education is committed to protecting the health of the children and adults in school buildings by strengthening the safety of foodservice operations.
Therefore, the Board requires the creation and implementation of a School Lunch Program Biosecurity Plan that will keep school meals free from intentional contamination and enable the foodservice to respond to threats or incidents of bioterrorism.
The School Lunch Program Biosecurity Plan shall be a document that spells out school lunch program policies and procedures that minimize the risk of intentional contamination of food and reduce the risk of illness or death in the school community.
The Plan shall describe strategies for preventing threats and incidents of product tampering and food contamination.
The Plan shall also include appropriate response actions to be taken should an incident occur.
There may be a general Plan for all the schools in the district; however, the Plan will address the specific roles and responsibilities for individual schools or locations where food is served.
The School Lunch Program Biosecurity Plan shall be prepared, revised, and updated in accordance with the requirements of N.J.A.C.
