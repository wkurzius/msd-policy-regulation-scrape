2360 - USE OF TECHNOLOGY
Section: Program
Date Created: October 2009
Date Edited: October 2009
The Board of Education recognizes the use of technology in the educational process is an essential part of the schooling experience.
Technology is to be viewed as a resource to enhance the learning process among other resources available to teachers and pupils.
In addition, technology can be used to enhance the administration of the schools and the district.
In order to provide direction and meaning to the use of technology as an instructional resource, the Board encourages and supports staff use of technology as a component of the learning process.
For purposes of this policy “technology” includes, but is not limited to, the use of computers and computer peripherals, communications networks, access to databases and libraries of information and the integration of audio, video, multimedia devices and media for purposes of teaching and learning.
The Superintendent, in consultation with teaching and support staff, shall recommend to the Board the acquisition of appropriate technology to best implement the curricular, instructional, and administrative program of the school district.
The Superintendent shall prepare a technology plan for the school district to encompass the following:
Curricular, Instructional and Administrative Need
The technology plan shall define the curricular, instructional and administrative need for technological equipment and media for the district.
In-service Education
The Board shall provide opportunities for school staff to participate in in-service programs on hardware or software programs to be used in the execution of educational and administrative tasks.
In-service programs may be provided in or out of the district.
Standards, Codes and References
All technology installations shall conform to the industry standards and applicable federal, State and local statutes and codes.
Facilities Planning
In all facilities projects involving new constructions, additions, and renovations the Superintendent or designee shall ensure the plans include provisions for current and future technology needs in terms of the structural, electric/electronic, mechanical, acoustical and visual systems of the building(s).
All educational specifications shall include features required for the use of instructional technology.
Computers
The school district will provide support or maintenance agreements for specified brands of computers.
All other computers purchased or donated will be subject to repair only when non-allocated funding is available and therefore may remain unrepaired until funding is available.
Computer Software Acquisition and Upgrading
The school district will only support the specified upgrades and training.
Staff members shall not purchase software that has not been included on a list of specified software or has been approved by the Director of Curriculum, Instruction and Assessment.
The Superintendent will recommend the purchase of upgrades to software as needed.
An evaluation of upgrades shall be made by appropriate personnel and no upgrade shall be purchased without the express approval of the Director of Curriculum, Instruction and Assessment.
Site Licenses
In the case where more than one copy of a software program is required, the Technology Coordinator shall attempt to acquire or negotiate a site license with the software developers.
In the event a site license is not possible, vendors shall be sought who will provide multiple copies at a discounted cost.
Software Copyright
All employees shall strictly adhere to the copyright laws of the United States.
No software shall be copied and/or distributed except in accordance with these laws.
All software placed on media workstations or any network with public access shall be copy protected by the Technology Coordinator, who shall assure that individuals who have access to such programs shall not copy them without authorization.
Internal Communication (District)
The school district shall provide communication between schools by a variety of means.
External Communications
The Board encourages the use of external communications so schools may utilize the vast resources of external databases and communicate with other schools, external agencies, and businesses throughout the world.
Gateways to such communications will be supported by the school district.
The use of particular gateways shall be approved by the Director of Curriculum, Instruction and Assessment.
The Director of Curriculum, Instruction and Assessment shall be responsible for the installation of software in district owned computers and/or computer systems that prevents access to gateways and Internet sites that have material considered by the Technology Coordinator to be inappropriate for use by pupils.

Teachers, pupils, or staff who create audio or video materials containing the voices or images of the individuals involved shall obtain proper releases from those individuals, their parent(s) or legal guardian(s) for instructional use within the school.
Informing Parents, Legal Guardians and Interested Parties
Upon request, the Building Principal shall make available to parent/legal guardians the computer hardware and software used in the district in order that a computer purchased privately for home use may be compatible with the computer and software the pupil uses in the school setting.
Technology Coordination
The Board shall appoint the Director of Curriculum, Instruction and Assessment to assure the technology needs of the district are met in the most efficient manner possible at the lowest costs available to meet specified needs.
