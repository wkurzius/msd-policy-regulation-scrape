Section: Finances
Date Created: December 2021
Date Edited: July 2023
M
Any vendor providing goods or services to the school district to be funded by a Federal grant must be cleared for contract in accordance with the provisions of the Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principals, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards (UGG), 2 CFR §200.213 – Suspension and Debarment.
The School Business Administrator/Board Secretary shall be responsible to check the web-based System for Award Management (SAM), accessible at www.sam.gov maintained by the United States government – the General Services Administration (GSA).
The purpose of the SAM is to provide a single comprehensive list of individuals and firms excluded by Federal government agencies from receiving Federal contracts or Federally approved contracts or Federally approved subcontracts and from certain types of Federal financial and nonfinancial assistance and benefits.
The School Business Administrator/Board Secretary, upon opening of bids or upon receipt of proposals for goods or services to be funded by a Federal grant shall access the SAM to determine if the vendor has been disbarred, suspended, or proposed for disbarment.
The School Business Administrator/Board Secretary shall also access the SAM list immediately prior to the award of a bid or contract to ensure that no award is made to a vendor on the list.
In the event a vendor under consideration to be awarded a bid or contract for goods or services to be funded by a Federal grant is on the SAM list or proposed for disbarment, the School Business Administrator/Board Secretary shall comply with the contracting restrictions as outlined in 2 CFR §200.
Continuation of current contracts and restrictions on subcontracting with vendors who are on the SAM list or proposed for disbarment shall be in accordance with the limitations as outlined in 2 CFR §200.
Any rejection of a bid or disqualification of a vendor who has been disbarred, suspended, or proposed for disbarment shall be consistent with the requirements as outlined in N.J.S.A.
18A:18A – Public School Contracts Law and all applicable State laws.
The applicability of the provisions of this Policy apply to covered transactions as defined in 2 CFR §3485.220.
A covered transaction is any contract that is awarded by the Board of Education that is covered under 2 CFR §180.210 and the amount of the contract is expected to equal or exceed $25,000, unless the Board chooses a lower threshold.
Compliance with the provisions of 2 CFR §200 and this Policy must be demonstrated by written evidence to be maintained by the School Business Administrator/Board Secretary.
Examples of evidence include printouts of searches from the SAM, imprints from an ink stamp, or Avery or similar labels affixed to purchase orders memorializing performance of this verification.
