2466 - NEEDLESS PUBLIC LABELING OF PUPILS WITH DISABILITIES (M)
Section: Program
Date Created: October 2009
Date Edited: October 2009
M
The Board of Education guarantees the privacy provided by law that no pupil with a disability be labeled publicly.
Therefore, any reference to a pupil with a disability brought to the attention of the Board and/or any other potential public reference to a pupil with a disability will be through the use of a district-developed method of coding that would ensure a pupil’s name or other labeling would not identify the pupil as a pupil with a disability.
Examples where public labeling of pupils with disabilities shall be avoided include, but are not limited to, Board meeting agenda information, public address announcements, building/classroom signs, public school documents, and/or any other school publication identifying a pupil with a disability or class/program of pupils with disabilities.
Special education classes shall be referred to publicly by the name of the teacher.
This applies to schedules, class lists, transportation lists, public address announcements, and any other form of communication that has any potential for any exposure other than for the use by appropriately authorized school staff.
Exceptions to the prohibition of public labeling of pupils with disabilities may be made upon consent of the pupil’s parent(s) or legal guardian(s).
All pupil records shall be maintained strictly in accordance with N.J.A.C.
