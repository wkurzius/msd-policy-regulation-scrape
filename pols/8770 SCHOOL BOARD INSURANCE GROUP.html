8770 - SCHOOL BOARD INSURANCE GROUP
Section: Operations
Date Created: October 2009
Date Edited: October 2009
The Board of Education shall provide insurance for loss or damage to school district property, real or personal; loss or damage from liability resulting from the use of district property; loss or damage from liability for the acts and omissions of school district officers or employees; loss or damage from liability established by the workers' compensation statutes; and the expenses of defending any claim against the Board members, officers, or employees of this district arising out of and in the course of the performance of their duties.
The Board recognizes the benefits to the school district of joining with other Boards of Education in providing coverage for the insurance needs of this district and in participating in programs of risk management to prevent loss and to control liability.
The Board may, upon formal resolution duly adopted, become a member of a school board insurance group in order to participate in any joint self-insurance fund or funds, risk management programs, or related services offered or provided by the group.
The Board's membership in the group will be governed by the bylaws of the insurance group, which must be reviewed and approved by the Commissioner of Insurance in accordance with State law.
Trustees of the school board insurance group shall be selected in accordance with the bylaws of the insurance group; if the bylaws do not provide for the manner of a trustee's election, the trustee or trustees representing this Board of Education shall be elected by a plurality vote of those Board members present and voting.
