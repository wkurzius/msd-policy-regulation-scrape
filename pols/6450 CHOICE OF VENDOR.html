District Policy
6450 - CHOICE OF VENDOR
Section: Finances
Date Created: October 2009
Date Edited: October 2009
The Board of Education recognizes its position as a major purchaser of goods and services in the community served by the school district.
It is the intention of the Board to purchase goods and services of the requisite quality at the lowest possible cost and to invite widespread competition in order to achieve this end.
Where all other considerations are equal, however, the Board will exercise a preference for dealing with established local merchants and service providers from within the boundaries of the school district.
The School Business Administrator/Board Secretary is authorized to place purchase orders with local merchants and providers when their prices and terms are competitive with other vendors.
Nothing in this policy shall be deemed to circumvent the requirements of law regarding public purchasing.
All vendors shall supply assurances that they do not practice discrimination as described in the administrative code.
All vendors shall be informed that harassment of any kind, of district pupils or employees by their representatives is prohibited.
