District Policy
5830 - PUPIL FUND RAISING
Section: Students
Date Created: October 2009
Date Edited: October 2012
The Board of Education recognizes the value of having pupils participate in fund-raising activities, either individually or as a group, in order to help defray the cost of certain non-curricular field trips, or other worthwhile programs, or in support of a bona fide charitable cause.
No pupils may sell anything on school property for their own financial benefit.
Principals shall review and decide appropriateness of fund-raising efforts by classes and groups in the individual school for school-related purposes.
The Superintendent shall review proposed activities which would involve more than one school or an outside purpose.
The Superintendent, in cooperation with Principals, shall develop regulations for the conduct of all in-school fund-raising activities by pupils and shall report such activities to the Board.
The Board shall review and act on all proposals for fund-raising activities by pupils outside school property.
All money shall be deposited and accounted for in accordance with Board policy and New Jersey law.
The annual school district audit shall include an audit of pupil organization funds.
Payments for the audit shall be made from district funds.
