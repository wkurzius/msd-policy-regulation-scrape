6210 - FISCAL PLANNING
Section: Finances
Date Created: October 2009
Date Edited: October 2009
The Board of Education shall collect and assemble the information necessary to discharge its responsibility for the fiscal management of the school district and to plan for the financial needs of the educational program.
The Board will strive toward maintaining both short and long range perspectives of district financial requirements.
Accordingly, the Board directs the School Business Administrator/Board Secretary to include cost estimates in all ongoing district studies of the educational program, to prepare a long range year-by-year plan for the maintenance and replacement of facilities and equipment, to forecast an estimated expenditure budget for one year in the future, to maintain a plan of anticipated state and federal revenues, to meet periodically with the municipal governing board to review planned expenditures and the joint effect of school and community costs on tax rates, and to report to the Board any serious financial forecast that emerges from the district's fiscal planning.
Adopted:  20 October 2009
