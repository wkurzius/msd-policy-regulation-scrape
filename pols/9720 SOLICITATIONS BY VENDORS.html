District Policy
9720 - SOLICITATIONS BY VENDORS
Section: Community
Date Created: October 2009
Date Edited: October 2009
The Board of Education will permit vendors to solicit pupils and parent(s) or legal guardian(s) for the sale of goods and services through the schools of this district, provided that the Board has given prior approval to the vendor and to the solicitation.
The Superintendent shall review each vendor's request to solicit sales and shall recommend to the Board for its approval only those that offer a product or service that is related to the educational goals of this district and offers good value to purchasers.
Any funds collected on behalf of a vendor approved by the Board under this policy shall be kept in a separate account pending transfer to the vendor.
The Board disclaims any responsibility for any such funds.
In the event that more than one vendor requests permission to solicit sales of a particular product or service, or the Superintendent seeks a vendor to provide a particular product or service to parent(s) or legal guardian(s) or pupils, the Superintendent shall seek quotations from qualified vendors in order to determine which will provide the greater value to purchasers.
The Board reserves the right to withdraw its approval of any vendor at any time.
Adopted:  20 October 2009
