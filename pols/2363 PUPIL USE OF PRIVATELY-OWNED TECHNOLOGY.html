2363 - PUPIL USE OF PRIVATELY-OWNED TECHNOLOGY
Section: Program
Date Created: September 2012
Date Edited: December 2017
The Board of Education recognizes technology is always changing and as a result of increased accessibility to technology many pupils possess technology devices for their use during non-school hours.
These privately-owned devices may be beneficial to pupils during school hours for approved educational purposes.
Therefore, the Board of Education will allow pupils to use their privately-owned technology devices under conditions outlined in this Policy.
For the purpose of this Policy, “technology” means hardware or software.
For the purpose of this Policy, “privately-owned” means technology hardware and software that is purchased, owned, and maintained by the pupil at no expense to the school or school district.
For the purpose of this Policy, “hardware” means any device that can store, access, retrieve, and/or communicate data or information.
“Hardware” may include, but is not limited to, any type of computer device; wireless telephone; electronic reader; personal digital assistant (PDAs); video broadcasting and/or recording device; or camera.
For the purpose of this Policy, “software” means any computer program(s) or related data that provide instruction for telling a computer or other hardware device what to do and how to do it.
A teaching staff member may approve a pupil’s use of privately-owned technology based on the assignment(s) to the pupil.
The teaching staff member may also prohibit the use of privately-owned technology for an assignment(s).
A pupil granted such permission must comply with school district policies and regulations regarding acceptable use of computers and technology.
Any use of privately-owned technology by a pupil shall be in strict accordance with the teaching staff member’s specific approval(s) and Board policies and regulations.
Any violation will subject the pupil to appropriate discipline and/or grading consequences.
The teaching staff member, in considering the use of privately-owned technology, will ensure such approval does not provide any advantage or benefit to the pupil who owns such technology over the pupil who does not own such technology.
The teaching staff member will not approve the use of privately-owned technology if the teaching staff member determines the use would be advantageous or beneficial to the pupil who owns such technology over the pupil who does not own such technology.
The school district assumes no responsibility for any privately-owned technology brought to school by a pupil.
The pupil shall be responsible for the proper operation and use of any privately-owned technology brought to school.
School staff members shall not be responsible for the effective use and/or technical support for any privately-owned technology.
The school district shall assume no responsibility for the security of or damage to any privately-owned technology brought to school by a pupil.
Pupils are encouraged to purchase private insurance for loss, damage, or theft of any privately-owned technology the pupil brings to school.
