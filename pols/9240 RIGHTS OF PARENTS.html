9240 - RIGHTS OF PARENTS
Section: Community
Date Created: October 2009
Date Edited: October 2009
The Board of Education recognizes that the parent(s) or legal guardian(s) of each child are ultimately responsible for the care and custody of that child, and that both parent(s) or legal guardian(s) share that responsibility equally.
The Board recognizes as well that, where only one parent has legal custody of a child, the rights and responsibilities of the other parent may be limited.
The Board believes that the interests of the child are best served by the continuing involvement of both parents in the child's life and well-being.
The Board will presume that each natural or adoptive parent(s) or legal guardian(s) of a pupil enrolled in this district possesses full parental rights of access to the pupil and to information about the pupil, notwithstanding any separation of the parent(s) or legal guardian(s) or dissolution of their marriage.
Accordingly, and in the absence of notice to the contrary, the Board directs that school administrators accommodate the needs of both parent(s) or legal guardian(s) for access to their child, to their child's teachers, and to information about their child.
Every parent, except as prohibited by federal and state law, shall have access to records and information pertaining to his/her unemancipated child, including, but not limited to, medical, dental, insurance, child care and educational records, whether or not the child resides with the parent, unless that access is found by the court to be not in the best interest of the child or the access is found by the court to be sought for the purpose of causing detriment to the other parent.
The place of residence of either parent shall not appear on any records or information released pursuant to the provisions of this section.
A child’s parent(s), guardian(s) or legal custodian(s) may petition the court to have a parent’s access to the records limited.
If the court, after a hearing, finds that the parent’s access to the record is not in the best interest of the child or that the access sought is for the purpose of causing detriment to the other parent, the court may order that access to the records be limited.
Proper notice of court action consists of the custodial parent's sworn affidavit or certification supported by a copy of the pertinent portion of a legal agreement or court order that awards custody and establishes the rights and limitation of the noncustodial parent or terminates the parental rights of the noncustodial parent.
Nothing in this policy shall be construed as limiting in any way the rights of the noncustodial parent whose parental rights have not been terminated to full access to his/her child's records.
