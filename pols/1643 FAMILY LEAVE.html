Date Edited: April 2021
The Board of Education will provide family leave to staff members in accordance with the New Jersey Family Leave Act (NJFLA) and the Federal Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA).
These laws have similar and different provisions that provide different rights and obligations for a staff member and the Board.
If a staff member is eligible for leave for reasons recognized under both the FMLA and NJFLA, then the time taken shall run concurrently and be applied to both laws.
The NJFLA provides twelve weeks leave in a twenty-four month period and the FMLA provides twelve weeks leave in a twelve month period

a.
NJFLA leave may be taken for up to twelve weeks within any twenty-four month period.
The NJFLA leave shall be unpaid with benefits subject to contributions required to be made by the staff member.

c.
Any period of NJFLA leave for the serious health condition of a family member of a staff member shall be supported by certification provided by a health care provider.
The certification shall be sufficient if it states: 
(1) The date, if known, on which the serious health condition commenced; 
(2) The probable duration of the condition; 
(3) The medical facts within the knowledge of the provider of the certification regarding the condition; 
(4) The serious health condition warrants the participation of the staff member in providing health care to the family member, as provided in the “Family Leave Act,” P.L.
1989, c.261 (C.34:11B-1 et seq.) and regulations adopted pursuant to the NJFLA;

In any case in which the Board has reason to doubt the validity of the certification provided pursuant to A.5.c.
above, the Board may require, at its own expense, that a staff member obtain an opinion regarding the serious health condition from a second health care provider designated or approved, but not employed on a regular basis, by the Board.
If the second opinion differs from the certification provided pursuant to A.5.c.
above, the Board may require, at its own expense, that a staff member obtain the opinion of a third health care provider designated or approved jointly by the Board and a staff member concerning the serious health condition.
The opinion of the third health care provider shall be considered to be final and shall be binding on the Board and a staff member.
e.
Where the certification is for an epidemic of a communicable disease, a known or suspected exposure to the communicable disease, or efforts to prevent the spread of the communicable disease, the certification shall be sufficient if it includes: 
(1) For NJFLA leave taken to provide in-home care or treatment of a child due to the closure of the school or place of care of the child of a staff member, by order of a public official due to the epidemic or other public health emergency, the date on which the closure of the school or place of care of the child of a staff member commenced and the reason for such closure;
(2) For NJFLA leave taken due to a public health authority’s issuance of a determination requiring or imposing responsive or prophylactic measures as a result of illness caused by an epidemic of a communicable disease or known or suspected exposure to the communicable disease because the presence in the community of a family member in need of care by a staff member would jeopardize the health of others, the date of issuance of the determination, and the probable duration of the determination; or
(3) For NJFLA leave taken because a health care provider or public health authority recommends that a family member in need of care by a staff member voluntarily undergo self-quarantine as a result of suspected exposure to a communicable disease because the presence in the community of that family member in need of care by a staff member would jeopardize the health of others, the date of the recommendation, the probable duration of the condition, and the medical or other facts within the health care provider or public health authority’s knowledge regarding the condition.

b.
If, during NJFLA leave, the Board experiences a reduction in force or layoff and a staff member would have lost their position had a staff member not been on NJFLA leave, as a result of the reduction in force or pursuant to the good faith operation of a bona fide layoff and 
recall system including a system under a collective bargaining agreement where applicable, a staff member shall not be entitled to reinstatement to the former or an equivalent position.

“Employee” means a staff member eligible for family and medical leave in accordance with the Federal Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA).
“Hours of Service” means hours actually worked by the employee.
It does not mean hours paid.
Thus, non-working time – such as vacations, holidays, furloughs, sick leave, or other time-off (paid or otherwise) – does not count for purposes of calculating FMLA eligibility for the employee.

“Serious health condition” may include treatment of substance abuse pursuant to                             29 CFR §825.119.
“Son” or “daughter” means a biological, adopted, or foster child, stepchild, a legal ward, or a child of a person standing in loco parentis, who is either under age eighteen or age eighteen or older and incapable of self-care because of a mental or physical disability at the time that FMLA leave is to commence.
“Spouse” means a husband or wife.
For purposes of this definition, husband or wife refers to the other person with whom an individual entered into marriage as defined or recognized under State law in the State in which the marriage was entered into or, in the case of a marriage entered into outside of 
any State, if the marriage is valid in the place where entered into and could have been entered into in at least one State.
This definition includes an individual in a same-sex marriage or common law marriage.
“Week” or “Workweek” means the number of days a staff member normally works each calendar week.

(3) In order to care for the spouse, son, daughter, or parent of a staff member if such spouse, son, daughter, or parent has a serious health condition;  
(4) For a serious health condition that makes a staff member unable to perform the functions of the position of such staff member.

3.
Staff Member Eligibility
a.
A staff member is eligible for up to twelve weeks of FMLA leave in a twelve month period.
b.
A staff member shall become eligible for FMLA leave after the staff member has been employed at least twelve months by the Board and employed for at least 1,250 hours of service during the twelve month period immediately preceding the commencement of the FMLA leave.
(1) The twelve months a staff member must have been employed need not be consecutive months pursuant to 29 CFR §825.110(b).
(2) The minimum 1,250 hours of service shall be determined according to the principles established under the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) for determining compensable hours of work pursuant to 29 CFR §785.

c.
The method to determine the twelve month period in which the twelve weeks of FMLA leave entitlement occurs will be a “rolling” twelve month period measured backward from the date a staff member uses any FMLA leave.
d.
Pursuant to 29 CFR §825.201, a husband and wife both employed by the Board are limited to a combined total of twelve weeks of FMLA leave during the twelve month period if the FMLA leave is taken for the birth of a son or daughter of a staff member or to care for such son or daughter after birth; for placement of a son or daughter with a staff member for adoption or foster care or in order to care for the son or daughter after placement; or to care for a staff member’s parent with a serious health condition.
4.
Types of FMLA leave
a.
Continuous FMLA leave is taken by staff members for a continuous period of time.
Such FMLA leave is not broken up by a period of work and is continuous when a staff member is absent for three consecutive working days or more.
Continuous FMLA leave may be taken for any qualifying reason.
b.
Intermittent FMLA leave is FMLA leave taken in separate blocks of time due to a single qualifying reason.
A reduced FMLA leave schedule is a FMLA leave schedule that reduces a staff member’s usual number of working hours per workweek, or hours per workday.
A reduced FMLA leave schedule is a change in a staff member’s schedule for a period of time, normally from full-time to part-time.
(1) Intermittent or reduced FMLA leave may be taken for the following qualifying reasons:
(a)  For the serious health condition of the staff member or to care for a parent, son, or daughter with a serious health condition.
(i)         For intermittent FMLA leave or FMLA leave on a reduced FMLA leave schedule taken for the reason outlined in B.4.b.(1)(a) above there 
must be a medical need for FMLA leave and it must be that such medical need can be best accommodated through an intermittent or reduced FMLA leave schedule.
(ii) The treatment regimen and other information described in the certification of a serious health condition and in the certification of a serious injury or illness, shall address the medical necessity of intermittent FMLA leave or FMLA leave on a reduced FMLA leave schedule.
(iii) Intermittent FMLA leave may be taken for a serious health condition of a parent, son, or daughter, for a staff member’s own serious health condition, which requires treatment by a health care provider periodically, rather than for one continuous period of time, and may include FMLA leave of periods from an hour or more to several weeks.
(b) For planned and/or unanticipated medical treatment of a serious health condition when medically necessary.
(c) To provide care or psychological comfort to a covered family member with a serious health condition when medically necessary.
(d) For absences where a staff member or family member is incapacitated or unable to perform the essential functions of the position because of a chronic serious health condition even if he or she does not receive treatment by a health care provider.
(e) For FMLA leave taken after the birth of a healthy child or placement of a healthy child for adoption or foster care, only if the Board agrees.
(i)         The Board’s agreement is not required; however, for FMLA leave during which the 
mother has a serious health condition in connection with the birth of her child or if the newborn child has a serious health condition.
(2) If a staff member needs FMLA leave intermittently or on a reduced FMLA leave schedule for planned medical treatment, then a staff member must make a reasonable effort to schedule the treatment so as not to disrupt unduly the Board’s operations.
(3) When a staff member takes FMLA leave on an intermittent or reduced FMLA leave schedule basis, the Board must account for the FMLA leave using an increment no greater than the shortest period of time that the Board uses to account for use of other forms of leave provided that it is not greater than one hour and provided further that a staff member’s FMLA leave entitlement may not be reduced by more than the amount of FMLA leave actually taken.
(a)  If the Board accounts for use of leave in varying increments at different times of the day or shift, the Board may not account for FMLA leave in a larger increment than the shortest period used to account for other leave during the period in which the FMLA leave is taken.
(b) If the Board accounts for other forms of leave use in increments greater than one hour, the Board must account for FMLA leave use in increments no greater than one hour.
5.
Staff Member Notice Requirements
a.
A staff member eligible for FMLA leave must give at least a thirty day written advance notice to the Superintendent or designee if the need for the FMLA leave is foreseeable based on an expected birth, placement for adoption or foster care, or planned medical treatment for a serious health condition of a staff member or a family member.
(1) If thirty days is not practical, a staff member must provide notice “as soon as practicable” which means as soon as both possible and practical, taking into account all the facts and circumstances in the individual case.
(2) Where it is not possible to give as much as thirty days’ notice, “as soon as practical” ordinarily would mean at least verbal notification to the Superintendent or designee within one or two business days or when the need for FMLA leave becomes known to a staff member.
(3) The written notice shall include the reasons for the FMLA leave, the anticipated duration of the FMLA leave, and the anticipated start of the FMLA leave.
(4) When planning medical treatment, a staff member must consult with the Superintendent or designee and make a reasonable effort to schedule the FMLA leave so as not to 
unduly disrupt the educational program, subject to the approval of the health care provider.
(a) Staff members are ordinarily expected to consult with the Superintendent or designee prior to scheduling of treatment that would require FMLA leave for a schedule that best suits the needs of the Board and a staff member.
(5) Intermittent FMLA leave or FMLA leave on a reduced FMLA leave schedule must be medically necessary due to a serious health condition or a serious injury or illness.
A staff member shall advise the Board of the reasons why the intermittent/reduced FMLA leave schedule is necessary and of the schedule for treatment, if applicable.
(a) A staff member and the Board shall attempt to work out a schedule for such FMLA leave that meets a staff member’s needs without unduly disrupting the Board’s operations, subject to the approval of the health care provider.
(6) Where a staff member does not comply with the Board’s usual notice and procedural requirements, and no unusual circumstances justify the failure to comply, FMLA-protected leave may be delayed or denied.
b.
When the approximate timing of the need for FMLA leave is not foreseeable, a staff member should give notice to the Superintendent or designee for FMLA leave as soon as practicable under the facts and circumstances of the particular case.
(1) It is expected a staff member will give notice to the Superintendent or designee within no more than one or two business days of learning of the need for FMLA leave, except in extraordinary circumstances where such notice is not foreseeable.
(2) A staff member should provide notice to the Board either in person, by telephone, telegraph, fax machine, email, or other electronic means.
6.

A staff member during any period of FMLA leave is prohibited from performing any services on a full-time basis for any person for whom a staff member did not provide services immediately prior to commencement of the FMLA leave.
(1) A staff member using FMLA leave may commence part-time employment that shall not exceed half the regularly scheduled hours worked for the Board.
(2) A staff member may continue the part-time employment that commenced prior to the FMLA leave at the same number of hours that a staff member was regularly scheduled prior to such FMLA leave.
7.
“Instructional Employees” Exceptions for FMLA Leave 
a.
“Instructional Employees” are those staff members whose principal function is to teach and instruct students in class, a small group, or in an individual setting.
This term includes teachers, athletic coaches, driving instructors, and special education assistants, such as signers for the hearing impaired.
(1) Teacher assistants or aides who do not have as their principal job actual teaching or instructing, guidance counselors, child study team members, curriculum specialists, cafeteria workers, maintenance workers, and/or bus drivers are not considered instructional staff members for the purposes of this Policy.
(2) For purposes of this Policy “Instructional Employees” shall be referred to as “Instructional Staff Members”.
b.
“Semester” means the school semester that typically ends near the end of the calendar year and the end of the spring each school year.
The Board can have no more than two semesters in a school year.
c.
FMLA leave taken at the end of the school year and continues into the beginning of the next school year is considered consecutive FMLA leave.
d.
Eligible instructional staff members that need intermittent or reduced FMLA leave to care for a family member or for a staff member’s own serious health condition which is foreseeable based on planned medical treatment and would be on FMLA leave more than twenty percent of the total number of working days over the period the FMLA leave would extend, the Board may:
(1) Require a staff member to take the FMLA leave for a period or periods of a particular duration, not greater than the duration of the planned treatment; or
(2) Transfer a staff member temporarily to an available alternative position for which a staff member is qualified, which has equivalent pay and benefits and which better accommodates recurring periods of FMLA leave than does a staff member’s regular position.
e.
If the instructional staff member does not give the required notice for FMLA leave that is foreseeable and desires the FMLA leave to be taken intermittently or on a reduced FMLA leave schedule, the Board may require a staff member to take FMLA leave of a particular duration, or to transfer temporarily to an alternative position.
Alternatively, the Board may require a staff member to delay taking the FMLA leave until the notice provision is met.
f.
If an instructional staff member begins FMLA leave more than five weeks before the end of the school year, the Board may require a staff member to continue taking FMLA leave until the end of the semester if:
(1) The FMLA leave will last three weeks; and
(2) A staff member would return to work during the three-week period before the end of the semester.
g.
If an instructional staff member begins FMLA leave for a purpose other than a staff member’s own serious health condition during the five week period before the end of the semester, the Board may require a staff member to continue taking FMLA leave until the end of the semester if:
(1) The FMLA leave will last more than two weeks; and
(2) The staff member would return to work during the two week period before the end of the semester.
h.
If an instructional staff member begins FMLA leave for a purpose other than a staff member’s own serious health condition during the three week period before the end of a semester, the Board may require a staff member to continue taking FMLA leave until the end of the semester if the FMLA leave will last more than five working days.
i.
An example of FMLA leave falling within the situations outlines in B.7.f., B.7.g., and B.7.h.
above:
(1) If a staff member plans two weeks of FMLA leave to care for a family member which will begin three weeks before the end of the term, the Board could require a staff member to stay out on FMLA leave until the end of the term.
j.
In the case of a staff member who is required to take FMLA leave until the end of an academic term, only the period of FMLA leave until a staff member is ready and able to return to work shall be charged against a staff member’s FMLA leave entitlement.
k.
The Board may require a staff member to stay on FMLA leave until the end of the school term.
Any additional leave required by the Board to the end of the school term is not counted as FMLA leave; however:
(1) The Board shall be required to maintain a staff member’s group health insurance; and 
(2) The Board shall be required to restore a staff member to the same or equivalent job including other benefits at the conclusion of the leave.
8.

c.
Military caregiver FMLA leave provides care for a covered servicemember with a serious injury or illness in accordance with 29 CFR §§825.122 and .127:

9.
Verification
a.
The Board shall require that a staff member's FMLA leave to care for a staff member's covered family member with a serious health condition, or due to a staff member's own serious health condition that makes a staff member unable to perform one or more of the essential functions of a staff member's position, be supported by a certification issued by the health care provider of a staff member or a staff member's family member.
(1)       The Board must give written notice of a requirement for certification each time a certification is required.
The Board's 
oral request to a staff member to furnish any subsequent certification is sufficient.
b.
The Board shall require a staff member furnish certification at the time a staff member gives notice of the need for FMLA leave or within five business days thereafter, or, in the case of unforeseen FMLA leave, within five business days after the FMLA leave commences.
(1) The Board may request certification at some later date if the Board later has reason to question the appropriateness of the FMLA leave or its duration.
(2)       A staff member must provide the requested certification to the Board within fifteen calendar days after the Board's request, unless it is not practicable under the particular circumstances to do so despite a staff member's diligent, good faith efforts or 
the Board provides more than fifteen calendar days to return the requested certification.
c.
When FMLA leave is taken because of a staff member's own serious health condition, or the serious health condition of a family member, the Board shall require a staff member to obtain a medical certification from a health care provider that sets forth the following information:
(1) The name, address, telephone number, and fax number of the health care provider and type of medical practice/specialization; 
(2)  The approximate date on which the serious health condition commenced, and its probable duration; 
(3) A statement or description of appropriate medical facts regarding the patient's health condition for which FMLA leave is requested.
The medical facts must be sufficient to support the need for FMLA leave.
(a)       Such medical facts may include information on symptoms, diagnosis, hospitalization, doctor visits, 
whether medication has been prescribed, any referrals for evaluation or treatment (physical therapy, for example), or any other regimen of continuing treatment; 
(4) If a staff member is the patient, information sufficient to establish that a staff member cannot perform the essential functions of a staff member's job as well as the nature of any other work restrictions, and the likely duration of such inability; 
(5)  If the patient is a covered family member with a serious health condition, information sufficient to establish that the family member is in need of care, and an estimate of the frequency and duration of the FMLA leave required to care for the family member; 
(6)  If a staff member requests FMLA leave on an intermittent or reduced schedule basis for planned medical treatment of a staff member's or a covered family member's serious health condition, information sufficient to establish the medicalnecessity for such intermittent or reduced schedule FMLA leave and an estimate of the dates and duration of such treatments and any periods of recovery; 
(7)  If a staff member requests FMLA leave on an intermittent or reduced schedule basis for a staff member's serious health condition, including pregnancy, that may result in unforeseeable episodes of incapacity, information sufficient to establish the medical necessity for such intermittent or reduced schedule FMLA leave and an estimate of the frequency and duration of the episodes of incapacity; and 
(8) If a staff member requests FMLA leave on an intermittent or reduced schedule basis to care for a covered family member with a serious health condition, a statement that such FMLA leave is medically necessary to care for the family member, which can include assisting in the family member's recovery, and an estimate of the frequency and duration of the required FMLA leave.
d.
A staff member may choose to comply with the certification requirement by providing the Board with an authorization, release, or waiver allowing the Board to communicate directly with the health care provider of a staff member or his or her covered family member.
(1) It is a staff member's responsibility to provide the Board with complete and sufficient certification and failure to do so may result in the denial of FMLA leave.
e.
If the Board has reason to doubt the validity of a medical certification, the Board may require a staff member to obtain a second opinion at the Board's expense.
(1) The Board may designate the health care provider to furnish the second opinion, but the selected health care provider may not be employed on a regular basis by the Board.
f.
If the opinions of a staff member's and the Board's designated health care providers differ, the Board may require a staff member to obtain certification from a third health care provider, again at the Board's expense.
This third opinion shall be final and binding.
The third health care provider must be designated or approved jointly by the Board and the staff member.
10.

On return from FMLA leave a staff member is entitled to be returned to the same position a staff member held when FMLA leave commenced, or to an equivalent position with equivalent benefits, pay, and other terms and conditions of employment.
(1) A staff member is entitled to such reinstatement even if a staff member has been replaced or his or her position has been restructured to accommodate for a staff member’s absence.
(2) The requirement that a staff member be restored to the same or equivalent job with the same or equivalent pay, benefits, and terms and conditions of employment does not extend to de minimis, intangible, or unmeasurable aspects of the job.
b.
Denial of Reinstatement 
(1) A staff member has no greater right to reinstatement or to other benefits and conditions of employment that if a staff member had been continuously employed during the FMLA leave period.
(a) The Board must be able to show that a staff member would not otherwise have been employed at the time reinstatement is requested in order to deny restoration to employment.
(2) The Board may deny job restoration to “key employees”, if such denial is necessary to prevent substantial and grievous economic injury to the operations of the Board.
(a) A “key employee” is a salaried FMLA-eligible staff member who is among the highest paid ten percent of all staff members employed by the Board within seventy-five miles of a staff member's worksite.
(3) If a staff member is unable to perform an essential function of the position because of a physical or mental condition, including the continuation of a serious health condition or an injury or illness also covered by workers’ compensation, a staff member has no right to restoration to another position under the FMLA.
(a) The Board’s obligation may; however, be governed by the Americans with Disabilities Act, State leave law, or workers’ compensation laws.
(4) A staff member who fraudulently obtains FMLA leave from the Board is not protected by FMLA's job restoration or maintenance of health benefits provisions.
c.
Intent to Return to Work
(1) The Board may require a staff member on FMLA leave to report periodically on a staff member's status and intent to return to work.
d.
Fitness for Duty Certification
(1) As a condition of restoring a staff member whose FMLA leave was a result of a staff member's own serious health condition that made a staff member unable to perform a staff member's job, the Board shall require all similarly-situated staff members (i.e., same occupation, same serious health condition) who take FMLA leave for such conditions to obtain and present certification from a staff member's health care provider that a staff member is able to resume work.
(2) A staff member has the same obligations to participate and cooperate in the fitness-for-duty certification process as in the initial certification process.

c.
Designation Notice
(1) The Board is responsible in all circumstances for designating leave as FMLA-qualifying, and for giving notice of the designation to a staff member.

(2) If the Board requires paid leave to be substituted for unpaid FMLA leave, or that paid leave taken under an existing leave plan be counted as FMLA leave, the Board must inform a staff member of this designation at the time of designating the FMLA leave.
12.
Local Board of Education Practices
a.
Substitution of Paid Leave
(1) Whether a staff member is required to use sick time or any other accrued leave time concurrent with FMLA leave time will depend upon either the district’s practice or a provision in the district’s collective bargaining agreement, if applicable.
