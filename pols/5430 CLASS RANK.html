5430 - CLASS RANK
Section: Students
Date Created: October 2009
Date Edited: September 2020
The Board of Education acknowledges the usefulness of a system for computing class rank for secondary school graduates for scholarship opportunities as needed.
Class rank will be provided directly to scholarship programs.
Class rank will be reported for admissions purposes and will not be entered on the pupil's transcript.
The Board authorizes a system of calculating class ranking for pupils no earlier than the completion of grade eleven.
In order to be ranked, a pupil must have been enrolled in Manville High School by the first day of school of his/her eleventh grade year.
Pupils who enroll after the first day of school of their eleventh grade year will be permitted to share a rank for scholarship purposes only.
Transfer courses will not receive additional weighting beyond that of the highest level courses available at Manville High School.
On occasion, two or more pupils may have an identical class rank, in which case, the affected pupils would share rank.
Rank in class will be determined based on the actual numeric average the pupil has achieved.
A six-semester class rank will be determined by including all courses with numerical final grades, not to exceed forty-one credits per year, in grades nine through eleven.
An eighth-semester cumulative class rank will be determined by including all courses with numerical final grades, not to exceed forty-six credits per year, nine through eleven, in addition to the first semester grades of the twelfth grade year.
Class rank will be based on the pupil's numeric average multiplied by the weight of the level of course as follows:
Level of Course      Weight
Advanced Placement      1.125
Honors    1.0625
Academic        1.00
This formula is computed as follows: Final grade x weight x credits = pupils weighted value for class rank.
The pupil with the highest points will be ranked number one.
The class valedictorian and salutatorian will be determined by an eighth-semester cumulative rank.
This number is not relative to a grade point average and will not be included on an individual transcript.
Beginning with the start of their senior year, pupils may request their six semester weighted value.
They may also request the range of numeric values that represent the top ten, twenty
and thirty percent of their class.
Upon request, the Guidance Department will provide ranges to students in each class starting in their sophomore year.
The top ten fall between an average of the range determined from the grades of that class; the top twenty fall between an average of the range determined from the grades of that class, etc.
