The Board of Education recognizes school building security measures are important for the safety and welfare of all students, staff, parents, and community members in school buildings.
In recognizing this important responsibility, the Principal or designee may require students to carry a school district issued Identification Card.
An Identification Card will be issued to all students in all school buildings,
The Identification Card shall have printed on the back the telephone number for the New Jersey Suicide Prevention Hopeline (NJ Hopeline) and contact information for a crisis text line pursuant to N.J.S.A.
18A:6-113.1.
The district may, in addition to the telephone number for the NJ Hopeline and contact information for a crisis text line, provide the contact information for the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline, a school district crisis center, or any other mental health support services pursuant to N.J.S.A.
18A:3B-73.2.
The Principal or designee may require a student to present their Identification Card at any time during the school day or at any time during a school-sponsored activity on school grounds.
Notwithstanding any provision of this Policy, the Principal or designee may also require students carry their Identification Card at any school-sponsored, off-campus activity, including but not limited to, field trips or interscholastic sports programs pursuant to N.J.S.A.
18A:36-43a.
The provisions of this Policy shall not be construed to require a student to carry the Identification Card while participating in an athletic contest or competition, an activity involving fine arts or performing arts, or any other activity that the Commissioner of Education determines does not require the physical possession of an Identification Card.

Any student who fails to have the Identification Card in their possession or fails to present it when required may be denied access to an event or activity and may be subject to appropriate discipline.
An Identification Card issued in accordance with this Policy shall not be considered a government record pursuant to P.L.
