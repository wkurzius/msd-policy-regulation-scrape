3230 - OUTSIDE ACTIVITIES
Section: Teaching Staff Members
Date Created: October 2009
Date Edited: November 2014
The Board of Education recognizes that teaching staff members enjoy a private life outside their job responsibilities in the school district.
The Board believes the role of the teaching profession is such that teachers exert a continuing influence away from the school district.
Accordingly, the Board reserves the right to determine if activities outside the teaching staff memberâ€™s job responsibilities interfere with their professional performance and the discharge of the member's responsibilities to the students of this district.
All teaching staff members are advised to be governed in the conduct of personal activities by the following guidelines:
1.
Teaching staff members shall not devote time during their work day to an outside private enterprise, business, or business organization.
They shall not solicit or accept customers for a private enterprise, business, and/or business organization on school grounds during their work day without the express permission of the Superintendent;
2.
The Board does not endorse, support, or assume liability in any way for any staff member of this district who takes students on trips not approved by the Board or Superintendent, and shall not be liable for the welfare of students who travel on such trips.
Any staff member who takes students of this district on a trip not approved by the Board or Superintendent shall clearly and concisely inform the parent(s) of any student solicited and/or attending such a trip that the trip is not endorsed, supported, approved, or authorized by the Board of Education.
A staff member shall not solicit students on school grounds for trips not approved by the Board or Superintendent;
3.
The Board does not endorse, support, or assume liability in any way for any teaching staff member of this district who conducts a private activity in which students or employees of this district participate;
4.
Teaching staff members shall not send campaign literature home with students, or request, direct, or have students distribute campaign literature on behalf of any candidate for local, State, or national office or for any bond issue, proposal, or any public question submitted at any general, municipal, or school election.
No student shall be requested or directed by any teaching staff member to engage in any activity which tends to promote, favor, or oppose any such candidacy, bond issue, proposal, or public question;
5.
Teaching staff members shall not privately tutor students for compensation that are currently enrolled in their classes; and
6.
Copyrights and patents to materials or equipment developed, written, prepared, processed, or tested by teaching staff members in the performance of their professional duties reside with and may be claimed by the Board.
