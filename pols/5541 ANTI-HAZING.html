Students, parents, volunteers, or visitors are encouraged to report an alleged incident of hazing that may take place or has taken place on or off school grounds to the Principal or designee on the same day when the individual witnessed or received reliable information regarding any such incident.
Any report of an alleged incident of hazing shall be immediately investigated by the Principal or designee in accordance with procedures used to investigate alleged violations of the Student Discipline/Code of Conduct and Policy and Regulation 5600.
A Principal or designee who receives a report of an alleged incident of hazing and fails to initiate or conduct an investigation and fails to minimize or eliminate the hazing may be subject to disciplinary action.
