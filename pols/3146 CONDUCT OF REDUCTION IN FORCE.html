3146 - CONDUCT OF REDUCTION IN FORCE
Section: Teaching Staff Members
Date Created: October 2009
Date Edited: October 2009
When teaching staff member positions have been abolished, in accordance with Board Policy No.
3112, the Board of Education will transfer and/or dismiss affected teaching staff members as required by law.
No tenured teaching staff member will be transferred or dismissed in a reduction in force affecting a category of employment in which a nontenured teaching staff member is employed.
When two or more nontenured teaching staff members are employed within the category affected by a reduction in force, the nontenured teaching staff member(s) shall be retained in that category who has demonstrated greater competence.
Tenure and seniority entitlements will govern the transfer and dismissal of tenured teaching staff members affected by a reduction in force, except that, when two or more tenured teaching staff members within the same employment category affected by a reduction in force possess an identical seniority entitlement to that category, the teaching staff member(s) shall be retained in that category who has demonstrated greater competence.
The Superintendent shall collect and maintain the information requisite to the calculation of each tenured teaching staff member's seniority status.
The Superintendent shall develop and maintain district seniority lists and shall recommend dismissals and transfers in a reduction in force in accordance with those lists.
No seniority list shall be a public document or published in the absence of a reduction in force or reemployment from a preferred eligible list.
Teaching staff members affected by a reduction in force will be informed of their seniority status and of the effect of the reduction in force on their employment, as promptly as possible after the Board's action to abolish positions.
Wherever possible, the Board will give sixty days notice of a pending dismissal.
If notice cannot be given a full sixty days before the end of the employee's service, salary in lieu of notice will be given for the remaining notice period beyond the end of service.
