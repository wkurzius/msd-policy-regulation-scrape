The Board of Education recognizes its responsibility to identify gifted and talented students within the school district and to provide these students with appropriate instructional adaptations and services.
To that end, the Board directs each such student in the school district be identified and offered an appropriate educational program and services.
For purposes of this Policy, “gifted and talented students” means students who possess or demonstrate high levels of ability in one or more content areas when compared to their chronological peers in the district and who require modification of their educational program if they are to achieve in accordance with their capabilities.
For the purpose of this Policy, “instructional adaptation” means an adjustment or modification to instruction enabling a student who is gifted and talented to participate in, benefit from, and demonstrate knowledge and application of the New Jersey Student Learning Standards in one or more content areas at the instructional level of the student, not just the student’s grade level.
The Superintendent of Schools or designee shall ensure that the appropriate instructional adaptations are designed for students who are gifted and talented.
The Superintendent or designee will develop procedures for an ongoing Kindergarten through grade twelve identification process for gifted and talented students that includes multiple measures in order to identify student strengths in intellectual ability, creativity, or a specific academic area.
The district shall ensure equal access to a continuum of gifted and talented education services.
The identification process shall include consideration of all students, including those who are English language learners and those with Individualized Education Plans or 504 Plans.
The Superintendent or designee will develop and document appropriate curricular and instructional modifications used for gifted and talented students indicating content, process, products, and learning environments, and including, but not limited to, additional education activities such as academic competitions, guest speakers, and lessons with a specialist.
The Superintendent or designee will take into consideration the Gifted Programming Standards, Position Statements, and White Papers of the National Association for Gifted Children in identifying and serving gifted and talented students.
The district will provide the time and resources to develop, review, and enhance instructional tools with modifications for helping gifted and talented students acquire and demonstrate mastery of the required knowledge and skills specified by the standards at the instructional level of the student.
The district will actively assist and support professional development for teachers, educational services staff, and school leaders in the area of gifted and talented instruction.
The district shall file with the New Jersey Department of Education Coordinator for Gifted and Talented Services a report by October 1, 2020 and thereafter on a schedule that coincides with the school district’s New Jersey Quality Single Accountability Continuum (QSAC) review pursuant to N.J.S.A.

Programs for gifted and talented students will be periodically evaluated for their continuing efficacy and adjusted accordingly.
The parent of any student identified as gifted or talented shall be consulted regarding any program designed to address the student’s particular needs.
