District Policy
7300 - DISPOSITION OF PROPERTY
Section: Property
Date Created: October 2009
Date Edited: October 2009
The Board of Education believes the efficient administration of the district requires the disposition of property and goods no longer necessary for school purposes.
The Board directs the periodic review of all district property and authorizes the disposition by sale, donation, or discard of any property no longer required for the maintenance of the educational program or the efficient management of the school district.
The disposition of any school property will be in accordance with this policy and applicable laws.
Real estate property will be disposed of by sale or otherwise, in accordance with N.J.S.A.
18A:20-5 and N.J.A.C.
6A:26-7.4.
If an approved site is to be altered or disposed of through sale, transfer or exchange of all or part of the total acreage, including facilities, if applicable, a written request for approval of the disposal will be made to the Department of Education in accordance with the requirements of N.J.A.C.
6A:26-7.4 et seq.
The Department of Education will notify the district of its approval or disapproval.
The Board may, by resolution and by sealed bid or public auction, authorize the sale of its personal property not needed for school purposes.
If the estimated fair value of the property to be sold exceeds fifteen percent of the bid threshold in any one sale and it is neither livestock nor perishable goods, it shall be sold at public sale, together with a description of the items to be sold and the conditions of sale, shall be published once in an official newspaper.
By resolution of the Board, the purchasing agent may include the sale of personal property no longer needed for school purposes as part of specifications to offset the price of a new purchase.
Personal property may be sold to the United States, the State of New Jersey, or to any body politic in the State of New Jersey, or any foreign nation which has diplomatic relations with these United States by private sale without advertising for bids.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this policy, property acquired with federal funds for use in a federally funded program will be disposed of in accordance with applicable law and guidelines.
The Superintendent shall develop regulations for the disposition of district property that provide for the review of the continued usefulness of all property in conjunction with the periodic inventory of property; the recommendation for Board designation of property for sale, donation, or discard; and the disposition of property in a fair and open manner consistent with the public interest and applicable laws.
