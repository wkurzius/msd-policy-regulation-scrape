Date Edited: October 2009
The Board of Education will indemnify any teaching staff member against loss of pay incurred by a call to jury duty.
No such employee will be penalized in any way for an absence caused by service on a panel of grand or petit jurors.
The time any such employee is absent on jury duty will not be charged against personal leave and will count as school district service.
Teaching staff members shall report a call to jury duty during the school term to the Principal or their immediate supervisor who shall determine whether or not a replacement is available.
Teaching staff members scheduled for jury service during the school term for whom the administration indicates a replacement cannot reasonably be found shall seek from the Assignment Judge an excusal or deferment of service.
Teaching staff members shall obtain from the Superintendent, or designee, a letter indicating the lack of availability of a substitute in such instances.
A teaching staff member who is a full-time teacher and is absent from school duties on jury duty for any court of New Jersey, any court of any other State, any federal district court, or in the U.S.
District Court for New Jersey will receive their usual compensation from the school district for each day the teaching staff member is present for jury duty.
An employee summoned to jury duty shall promptly report the summons to his/her immediate supervisor.
On return from jury duty, the employee must submit to his/her immediate supervisor a court record of the number of days served on jury duty.
While on jury duty, an employee must report daily to his/her supervisor the schedule for the following day and must report to work when he/she is excused from jury duty for half a day or more or suffer loss of pay.
