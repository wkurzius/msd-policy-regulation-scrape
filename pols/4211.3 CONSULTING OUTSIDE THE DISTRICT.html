Recognizing that the school district will request the expertise from support staff members from other school districts, agencies and other entities, the Board supports sharing of its support staff members with other school districts, agencies, and other entities to the extent it does not interfere with the efficient operation of the school district.
The Superintendent may recommend to the Board a support staff memberâ€™s attendance in another school district, agency or other entity without additional remuneration to the support staff member or school district, upon a written request from the agency or from the support staff member.
