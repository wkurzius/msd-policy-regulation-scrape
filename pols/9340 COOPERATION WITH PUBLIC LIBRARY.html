District Policy
9340 - COOPERATION WITH PUBLIC LIBRARY
Section: Community
Date Created: October 2009
Date Edited: October 2009
The public library can and should play an important role in the intellectual and educational development of children attending district schools, serving them as a resource that reinforces and augments the school library in many areas and by providing services and materials that may go beyond those that the school library alone can provide.
The Board of Education encourages the effective utilization of the public library by communication and cooperation between the school and library staff.
School staff members should be kept informed of new materials and services available from the public library and library staff members should be kept advised of school projects and programs that call for pupil use of the public library.
N.J.A.C.
