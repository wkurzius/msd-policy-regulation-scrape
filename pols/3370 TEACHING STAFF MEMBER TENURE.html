3370 - TEACHING STAFF MEMBER TENURE
Section: Teaching Staff Members
Date Created: October 2009
Date Edited: October 2009
The Board of Education recognizes that the benefit of tenure is conferred by law on teaching staff members who have completed the requisite period of probationary service in this school district.
The Board also recognizes that certain service does not qualify the teaching staff member who performs that service for the grant of tenure.
Tenure in any administrative or supervisory position as listed in N.J.S.A.
18A:28-5 shall accrue only by employment in that administrative or supervisory position.
Tenure so accrued will not extend to any other administrative or supervisory position and nothing shall limit or restrict tenure rights which were or may be acquired pursuant to N.J.S.A.
18A:28-6.
The Board specifically directs that service in the following positions will not accrue toward the tenure status and will be performed only under contract renewable at the discretion of the Board:
1.
Substitute teacher acting in the absence of another employee;
2.
Summer school teacher;
3.
Co-curricular advisor;
4.
Athletic coach; and
5.
Department chairperson other than a supervisor.
Nothing in this policy will be deemed to confer tenure on any employee who serves in a position not listed above and for whom tenure is not provided by law.
N.J.S.A.
18A:16-1.1; 18A:28-3 et seq.; 18A:28-5 et seq.
Adopted:  20 October 2009
