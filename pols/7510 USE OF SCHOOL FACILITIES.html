Section: Property
Date Created: October 2009

The district facilities belong to the community, which paid for them for the primary purpose of offering a full educational program for its children.
Prudent use and management of school facilities outside of the regular operating schedules - providing that such use does not interfere with the orderly conduct of a thorough and efficient system of education - allows the community to benefit more broadly from the use of its' own property.
The use of school facilities will not be permitted for private social functions, partisan political activity or any purpose that is prohibited by law.
For scheduling priority and establishing usage fees, groups or individuals are placed in one of four groups as defined below:
Group 1 – Manville School District and Manville School District sponsored organizations including school related curricular and co-curricular activities that are supervised by school district staff, such as non-profit parent organizations and clubs recognized by the Board of Education.
Group 2 – all non-profit civic and community organizations and community members not identified above.
Group 3 – Government agencies and the State of New Jersey.
Group 4 – All organizations and individuals not included in Group 1, 2 or 3 as defined above.
