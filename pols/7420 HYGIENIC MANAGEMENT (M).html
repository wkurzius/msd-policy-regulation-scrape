M
The Board of Education recognizes that the health and physical well-being of the pupils and staff of this district depend in large measure upon the cleanliness and sanitary management of the schools.
The Board directs that a program of hygienic management be instituted in the schools and explained annually to all staff members.
Each school shall be inspected for cleanliness and sanitation by the Principal not less than once each year.
The Board will cooperate with the local board of health in the sanitary inspection of the schoolsâ€™ toilets, washrooms, food vending machines, water supply, and sewage disposal systems.
The Superintendent shall prepare, in consultation with the school medical inspector, regulations, first aid and emergency medical procedures that utilize universal precautions in the handling and disposal of blood and body fluids, whether or not pupils or staff members with HIV infection are present.
School staff members and volunteers shall be provided the supplies for implementing the procedures.
In particular, school nurses, custodians, and teachers shall be trained in proper handling procedures.
These regulations and procedures will comply with the regulations of the State Department of Health and State Department of Labor (OSHA Standards for Occupational Exposure to Bloodborne Pathogens) and recommendations of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Bloodborne Pathogens
The Board recognizes that school employees may in the performance of their duties reasonably anticipate contact with human blood or other potentially infectious body fluids that may expose them to bloodborne pathogens such as Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) and Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV).
In accordance with federal OSHA regulations, the Board will establish a written Exposure Control Plan designed to eliminate or minimize employee exposure to such infection.
The plan shall list all job classifications and tasks in which exposure occurs; describe and require the implementation of workplace controls to eliminate or minimize exposure; require the provision of hepatitis B vaccination to employees who have occupational exposure; and require the provision of a training program for employees who have occupational exposure.
The plan shall be updated annually and as required to include new or revised employee positions with occupational exposure.
A copy of the plan shall be made accessible to employees.
Disposal of Medical Waste
The Superintendent shall prepare, in consultation with the school medical inspector, a medical waste disposal program to ensure all medical waste, including needles and sharps, are disposed of in accordance with the rules and regulations of the New Jersey Department of Health.
Chemical Hygiene
The Board also recognizes that certain school employees who work in laboratories may be exposed to hazardous chemicals in the course of their duties.
In accordance with federal OSHA regulations, the Board will establish practices that are capable of protecting employees from health hazards presented by hazardous chemicals used in the workplace.
The plan shall contain the locations of hazardous chemicals and shall enunciate a plan capable of protecting employees from associated health hazards and keeping exposure of employees below specified limits.
The Chemical Hygiene Plan shall be readily available to employees and shall contain at least the following elements:
1.
Standard operating procedures for using hazardous chemicals in laboratory work;
2.
Criteria that the Board will use to determine and implement control measures to reduce employee exposure;
3.
The requirement that fume hoods and other protective equipment are functioning properly and that measures are taken to ensure adequate performance of such equipment;
4.
Provision for employee information and training;
5.
The circumstances under which a particular laboratory operation, procedure or activity shall require prior approval from the Supervisor of Buildings and Grounds before implementation;
6.
Provisions for medical consultation;
7.
Designation of personnel responsible for implementation of the chemical hygiene plan; and
8.
Provisions for additional employee protection for work with particularly hazardous substances.
The Superintendent shall develop and supervise a program for the cleanliness and sanitary management of the school buildings, school grounds, and school equipment pursuant to statute, rules of the State Board of Education, and regulations of the State Board of Health.
The day to day monitoring of the cleanliness of each school building shall be the responsibility of the Building Principal.
