District Policy
9200 - COOPERATION BETWEEN PARENTS AND SCHOOL
Section: Community
Date Created: October 2009
Date Edited: October 2009
The Board believes that the education of children is a joint responsibility, one it shares with the parent(s) or legal guardian(s) of the-school community.
To ensure that the best interests of the child are served in this process, a strong program of communication between home and school must be maintained and parental involvement in district concerns encouraged.
The Board recognizes the vital role of parent(s) or legal guardian(s) in the welfare and education of their children and the pivotal part they play in shaping character and values.
Because parent(s) or legal guardian(s) are familiar with the needs, problems, gifts, and abilities of their children, staff should seek to involve parent(s) or legal guardian(s) as much as possible in the planning of the individual program.
Parent(s) or legal guardian(s) can support their children's educational efforts by:
1.
Being familiar with the rules of the district;
2.
Ensuring their child's regular attendance at school, on time, properly dressed and in a condition of physical health and mental alertness to benefit from instruction;
3.
Cooperating with school staff in educational and disciplinary matters;
4.
Communicating to appropriate school staff changes in the child's home life that may affect conduct or performance.
Parent(s) or legal guardian(s) are specifically requested to inform the school of any changes in legal custody of the child;
5.
Taking an active part, when possible, in the affairs of the school and the district;
6.
Maintaining an active interest in the pupils' daily work and making it possible for the pupil to complete assigned homework through providing a quiet place and suitable conditions for study; and
7.
Reading all communications from the school, and signing and returning them promptly when required.
The Superintendent shall develop procedures and regulations to implement this policy.
These regulations shall include use of the parent(s) or legal guardian(s)â€™ native language when necessary.
