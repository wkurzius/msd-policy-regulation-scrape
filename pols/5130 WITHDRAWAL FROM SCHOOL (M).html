Date Edited: October 2009
M
The Board of Education believes that the educational goals of this district are best implemented by a pupil's exposure to the entire educational program and that every pupil enrolled in this district should be encouraged to complete the program of instruction appropriate to his/her needs.
No pupil below the age of sixteen will be permitted to withdraw from school.
The Superintendent shall alert teaching staff members to identify those pupils who may consider eighth grade graduation the termination of their education.
Any pupil who indicates that he/she may drop out of school before entry to the ninth grade should be reported to the Building Principal and be provided with counseling.
The Board directs that efforts be made to determine the underlying reason for a pupil's decision to withdraw from school before the completion of the instructional program.
A potential dropout pupil will be offered counseling and an opportunity to plan an instructional program appropriate to his/her career goals.
No pupil under the age of eighteen will be permitted to withdraw without the written consent of the pupil's parent(s) or legal guardian(s).
Counseling services and information regarding high school equivalency programs will be made available to any pupil sixteen years of age or older who decides to withdraw from school before completion of the requirements for a diploma.
A pupil who has withdrawn from school may apply for readmission at any time prior to his/her twentieth birthday, provided application for readmission is made at the beginning of a school term.
