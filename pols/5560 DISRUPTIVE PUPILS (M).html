For the purposes of this policy, "disruptive pupil" means the pupil who has difficulty establishing good relationships with peers and adult authority figures and who exhibits a pattern of conduct which is in defiance of school rules or regulations and which hinders academic success for other pupils as well as for himself or herself.
Disruptive pupils may be disciplined in accordance with Policy No.
