5420 - REPORTING PUPIL PROGRESS (M)
Section: Students
Date Created: October 2009
Date Edited: October 2009
M
The Board of Education believes that the cooperation between school and home in the interests of children is fostered by the systematic communication of pupilsâ€™ educational welfare to parent(s) or legal guardian(s).
The Board directs the establishment of a program of reporting pupil progress to parent(s) or legal guardian(s) by both written reports and by parent-teacher conferences and requires the cooperation of all appropriate teaching staff members in that program as part of their professional responsibilities.
The Superintendent shall develop, in consultation with appropriate teaching staff members, procedures for reporting pupil progress to parent(s) or legal guardian(s) that utilize various methods of reporting appropriate to grade level and curriculum content; ensure that the pupil and parent(s) or legal guardian(s) receive ample warning of a possible failing grade or any grade that would adversely affect the pupil's educational status; enable the scheduling of parent-teacher conferences at such times as will ensure the greatest degree of participation by parent(s) or legal guardian(s); and require the issuance of report cards at intervals of not less than four times per year.
Reports of individual achievement on state assessment tests shall be promptly made available to the pupil or the pupil's parent(s) or legal guardian(s).
