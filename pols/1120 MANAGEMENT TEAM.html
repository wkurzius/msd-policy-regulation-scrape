1120 - MANAGEMENT TEAM
Section: Administration
Date Created: October 2009
Date Edited: October 2009
The Board of Education recognizes the value of a system of management organization that enhances communication among administrators and between the administration and the Board, encourages a shared responsibility for educational policy decisions, and provides for the equitable resolution of conflicts.
The Board directs the Superintendent to establish a management team that includes the Superintendent and those administrative, supervisory, and support staff members who are responsible for employee evaluation, the adjudication of grievances, supervision of employees, or recommendations regarding the employment of employees.
The Superintendent shall institute a management team system that will provide a means for:
1.
Submitting recommendations to the Board on issues of educational policy;
2.
Addressing the economic concerns and working conditions of management team members, including their job descriptions, evaluation, salaries, fringe benefits, promotions, assignments, and transfers;
3.
The development of administrative procedures; and
4.
The consideration of such additional and appropriate issues as may be identified by the Superintendent or the management team.
