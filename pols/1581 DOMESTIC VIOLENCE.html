11A:2-6a.
The purpose of the Uniform Domestic Violence Policy is to encourage public employees who are victims of domestic violence, and those impacted by domestic violence, to seek assistance from their public employer’s human resources officer(s) and to provide a standard for a public employer’s human resources officer(s) to follow when responding to employees.
Policy and Regulation 1581 – Section B.
provides employment protection for employees of those employers as defined in N.J.S.A.
34:11C-2, who are victims of domestic violence or sexual violence in accordance with the provisions of the New Jersey Security and Financial Empowerment Act (NJ SAFE Act) - N.J.S.A.

A.
Uniform Domestic Violence Policy  (N.J.S.A.
11A:2-6a)
All New Jersey public employees are covered under N.J.S.A.
11A:2-6a and Policy and Regulation 1581 – Section A.
All public employers shall designate a Human Resources Officer (HRO) or equivalent to assist employees who are victims of domestic violence.
The name and contact information of the designated HRO must be provided to all employees.
Managers and supervisors are required to refer any employee who is experiencing domestic violence or who report witnessing domestic violence to the designated HRO.
Employees who are victims of domestic violence are encouraged to seek immediate assistance from their HRO.
Employees who have information about or witness an act of domestic violence against an employee are encouraged to report that information to the designated HRO, unless the employee is required to report the domestic violence
to applicable laws, guidelines, standard operating procedures, internal affairs policies, or New Jersey Attorney General directives and guidelines that impose a duty to report, in which case the employee must report to the appropriate authority in addition to reporting to the designated HRO.
Nothing in the Uniform Domestic Violence Policy and Policy and Regulation 1581 – Section A.
shall preclude an employee from contacting 911 in emergency situations.
HROs shall remind employees to contact 911 if they feel they are in immediate danger.
Each designated HRO shall comply with the requirements outlined in Regulation 1581 – Section A.4.d.
In responding to reports of domestic violence, the HRO shall seek to maintain confidentiality to protect an employee making a report of, witnessing, or experiencing domestic violence, to the extent practical and appropriate under the circumstances and allowed by law.
To ensure confidentiality and accuracy of information, the Uniform Domestic Violence Policy 1581 and Regulation 1581 – Section A.6.
require the HRO to keep all documents and reports of domestic violence in a confidential personnel file separate from the employee's other personnel records.
Public employers in the State of New Jersey shall develop an action plan to identify, respond to, and correct employee performance issues that are caused by domestic violence, pursuant to N.J.S.A.
11A:2-6a, and in accordance with the guidelines outlined in Regulation 1581 - Section A.7.
Resources and program information will be readily available to assist victims of domestic violence.
A public employer may seek to modify Policy and Regulation 1581 to create additional protocols to protect victims of domestic violence, but may not modify in a way that reduces or compromises the safeguards and processes set in the Uniform Domestic Violence Policy.
