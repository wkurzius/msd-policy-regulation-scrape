M
The Board of Education recognizes that depression and self-destruction are problems of increasing severity among students.
Students under severe stress cannot benefit fully from the educational program and may pose a threat to themselves or others.
The Board directs all school district staff members to be alert to a student who exhibits warning signs of self-destruction or who threatens or attempts suicide.
Any such warning signs or the report of such warning signs from another student or staff member shall be taken with the utmost seriousness and reported immediately to the Principal or designee.
The Principal or designee shall immediately contact the parent(s) of the student exhibiting warning signs of suicide to inform the parent(s) the student will be referred to the Child Study Team or a Suicide Intervention Team, appointed by the Superintendent or designee, for a preliminary assessment.
Upon completion of the preliminary assessment, the Principal or designee shall meet with the parent(s) to review the assessment.
Based on the preliminary assessment, the parent(s) may be required to obtain medical or psychiatric services for the student.
In the event the parent objects to the recommendation or indicates an unwillingness to cooperate in the best interests of the student, the Principal or designee will contact the New Jersey Department of Children and Families, Division of Child Protection and Permanency to request intervention on the student’s behalf.
In the event the student is required to obtain medical or psychiatric services, the parent(s) will be required to submit to the Superintendent, or designee a written medical clearance from a licensed medical professional, selected by the parent(s) and approved by the Superintendent, indicating the student has received medical services, does not present a risk to themselves or others, and is cleared to return to school.
The written medical clearance may be reviewed by a Board of Education healthcare professional before the student is permitted to return to school.
The parent(s) shall be required to authorize their healthcare professional(s) to release relevant medical information to the school district’s healthcare professional, if requested.
Any school district staff member, volunteer, or intern with reasonable cause to suspect or believe that a student has attempted or completed suicide, shall immediately report the information to the Principal or designee or their immediate supervisor who will immediately report it to the Superintendent or designee.
The Superintendent or designee shall promptly report it online to the New Jersey 
Department of Children and Families, or as otherwise required by the Department of Children and Families in accordance with N.J.S.A.
