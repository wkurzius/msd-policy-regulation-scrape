9260 - PARENTAL LIABILITY FOR VANDALISM
Section: Community
Date Created: October 2009
Date Edited: October 2009
The school property held in trust by this Board of Education represents a substantial investment of the taxpayers of the school district; liability for the willful and malicious destruction of that property should be borne by those directly and indirectly responsible.
The Board further believes that parent(s) or legal guardian(s) are ultimately responsible for the supervision and discipline of pupils and that the knowledge that they are vicariously liable for the acts of their children and wards will encourage parent(s) or legal guardian(s) to exercise that responsibility more vigorously.
Where any property, real or personal, owned by this Board has been willfully and maliciously damaged by any minor, whether or not the person is enrolled in this district, the Board shall bring civil action against the parent(s) or legal guardian(s) having legal custody and control of the person at the time the damage was caused, for the full amount of the damage.
N.J.S.A.

Adopted:  20 October 2009
