Section: Students
Date Created: October 2009
Date Edited: October 2013
M
The American Heart Association estimates many lives could be saved if defibrillators were more widely available.
Due to technological advances, automated external defibrillators (AEDs) may be used by lay persons without any training to provide defibrillation within the first minutes of cardiac arrest thereby increasing the victimâ€™s chances of survival.
In accordance with N.J.S.A.
18A:40-41.a, the Board of Education shall ensure every school in the school district has an AED as defined in N.J.S.A.
2A:62A-24.
The AED shall be made available in an unlocked location on school property with an appropriate identifying sign.
The AED shall be accessible during the school day and any other time when a school-sponsored athletic event or team practice is taking place in which pupils of the school district are participating.
The AED shall be within reasonable proximity of the school athletic field or gymnasium, as applicable.
A team coach, licensed athletic trainer, or other designated staff member if there is no coach or licensed athletic trainer, who is present during athletic events or team practices, shall be trained in cardio-pulmonary resuscitation and the use of the AED in accordance with the provisions of N.J.S.A.
2A:62A-25.a.
The school district shall be deemed to be in compliance with N.J.S.A.
2A:62A-25.a, if a State-certified emergency services provider or other certified first responder is on site at the event or practice.

The Emergency Action Plan shall be consistent with the provisions of N.J.S.A.

This list shall be updated, if necessary, at least once in each semester of the school year.
The Emergency Action Plan shall also include detailed procedures on responding to a sudden cardiac event including, but not limited to, the identification of the persons in the school who will be responsible for responding to the person experiencing the sudden cardiac event; calling 911; starting cardio-pulmonary resuscitation; retrieving and using the AED; and assisting emergency responders in getting to the individual experiencing the sudden cardiac event.
