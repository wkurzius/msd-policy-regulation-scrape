A teaching staff member shall not engage in political activity on school grounds unless permitted in accordance with Board Policy No.

2.
A teaching staff member shall not post political circulars or petitions on school grounds nor distribute such circulars or petitions to students nor solicit campaign funds or campaign workers on school grounds;

A teaching staff member shall not display any material that would tend to promote any candidate for office on an election day on school grounds that are used as a polling place;
4.
A teaching staff member shall not engage in any activity in the presence of students while on school grounds, which is intended and/or designed to promote, further or assert a position(s) on labor relations issues.
In accordance with N.J.S.A.
18A:6-8.1., a teaching staff member employed by this district who is a member of the Senate or General Assembly of the State of New Jersey shall be entitled to time off from school district duties, without loss of pay, during the periods of the teaching staff member’s attendance at regular or special sessions of the legislature and hearings or meetings of any legislative committee or commission.
In accordance with N.J.S.A.

No other teaching staff member who holds elective or appointive office is entitled to time off, except as such time off may be provided for by Board policy or negotiated agreement.
The provisions of this Policy do not apply to the discussion and study of politics and political issues appropriate to the curriculum, the conduct of student elections, or the conduct of employee representative elections.
