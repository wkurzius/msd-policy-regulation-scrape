9400 - NEWS MEDIA RELATIONS
Section: Community
Date Created: October 2009
Date Edited: October 2009
Representatives of the local newspapers and radio and television stations are an important link in the communications chain between the school district and the community it serves.
The maintenance of a good working relationship with members of the media is essential to meeting the objectives of the district's school and community relations program.
The Board of Education must give formal approval to all basic practices governing relations between news media and the district and reserves the right to negotiate, on terms most favorable to the district, for the radio broadcasting, televising, filming, or sound recording of any school event by an outside agency.
The Superintendent shall be the chief communications representative of the Board.
He/she shall be readily available to media representatives, provide media representatives with all appropriate and necessary information, suggest or supply feature articles or stories, prepare "press kits," assist school and parent organizations with press relations, meet periodically with media representatives, and protect school personnel from any unnecessary demands on their time by news media representatives.
The Superintendent must approve in advance interviews between staff members or pupils and media representatives and authorize the release of photographs, video or digital images of district subjects, personnel, or pupils.
Photographs, video or digital images of disabled children shall not be disseminated or used in print or media in any way if they are identified as disabled unless permission is granted by the parent(s) or legal guardian(s).
Photographs, video or digital images of children placed in the district by DYFS shall not be published without the permission of the Division case worker.
Where the release of a photograph may violate the privacy of a pupil or staff member, the Superintendent or designee must first secure the written permission of the staff member or the pupil's parent(s) or legal guardian(s).
Adopted:  20 October 2009
