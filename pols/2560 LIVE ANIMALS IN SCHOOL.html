Date Edited: October 2009
The Board of Education recognizes that the appropriate use of live animals as instructional resources can enrich the educational program.
The observation and nurture of live animals can help children learn specific biological and behavioral principles and gain respect for all living things.
A staff member who uses live animals shall observe proper precautions for the safety of pupils and the animals.
The Principal must approve the use of any animal in a course of instruction or the establishment of an animal habitat in a classroom.
Any animal used in school must have been lawfully acquired in accordance with applicable state law and local ordinance.
An animal susceptible to rabies must have been vaccinated against rabies.
No animal shall be permitted in any area of the school where a pupil who is allergic to the animal might be exposed to the animal.
A teacher or other qualified adult must assume primary responsibility for the animal, its nourishment, and its sanitary living conditions.
The staff member in charge must make proper arrangements for the animal's care and feeding over weekends, holidays, and school vacation periods.
Any experiment that deprives the animal of nourishment or exposes the animal to harm must be conducted under strict supervision and as humanely as possible.
The effects of the experiment must be reversed as quickly as possible.
If correction is not possible or feasible, the animal must be disposed of by humane methods.
