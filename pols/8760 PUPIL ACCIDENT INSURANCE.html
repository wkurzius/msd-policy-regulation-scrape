Section: Operations
Date Created: October 2009
Date Edited: October 2009
The Board of Education recognizes injuries to pupils may occur from accidents occurring in the course of attendance at school and participation in the athletic and co-curricular programs of the school district.
In accordance with the provisions of N.J.S.A.
18A:43-1, the Board is not required to, but may arrange for, maintain, and may pay the premiums for insurance coverage by a qualified insurer for loss sustained by pupils through accidental means while participating in those school activities insured by the Board’s insurance provider.
This insurance coverage, if purchased by the Board, will not cover all school activities and will be secondary insurance requiring all claims be submitted to the pupil’s parent’s or legal guardian’s insurance provider before being submitted to the school district’s insurance provider.
All claim decisions and payment amounts will be made by the school district’s insurance provider in accordance with the terms of the insurance policy purchased by the Board.
The insurance coverage provided under this program will be based on a payment schedule and may not provide for full payment of such claims.
The Board, if such insurance is provided, may require payment to the Board by pupils to whom the benefit of such insurance is extended, of a proportional share of premiums or any part thereof in accordance with the provisions of N.J.S.A.
18A:43-2.
In the event the Board requires such payment, the amount to be paid by pupils shall be established by a schedule determined by the Board, but no pupil electing not to participate in the accident insurance coverage shall be required to make any payment toward the cost of the premiums.
The Board may provide parent(s) or legal guardian(s) the opportunity to purchase insurance coverage, at no cost to the Board, for injury resulting from accidents sustained by pupils occurring in the course of attendance at school and participation in the athletic and co-curricular programs of the school district.
The Superintendent and/or designee will recommend suitable and qualified insurance providers for Board consideration and approval.
Parent(s) or legal guardian(s) of pupils who may be eligible for such insurance coverage will be notified of its availability.
In accordance with the provisions of N.J.S.A.
18A:43-3, in the event the Board elects to provide this pupil accident insurance, it shall not be construed to impose any liability on the part of the Board for an injury sustained by a pupil as a result of or in connection with any activities outlined in N.J.S.A.
18A:43-1 or as a result of or in connection with the conduct of the physical education program of the school district.
N.J.S.A.
18A:43-1; 18A:43-2; 18A:43-3
Adopted:  20 October 2009
