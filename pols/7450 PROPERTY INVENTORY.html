District Policy
7450 - PROPERTY INVENTORY
Section: Property
Date Created: October 2009
Date Edited: December 2020
The Board of Education recognizes that efficient management and the replacement of lost, damaged, or stolen property depends upon an accurate inventory and properly maintained records.
The district shall maintain a complete inventory by physical count of all district-owned equipment.
For the purpose of this Policy, “equipment” shall mean any instrument, machine, apparatus, or set of articles which meets all of the following criteria and the cost is above $2,000: 
1.
It retains its original shape, appearance, and character with use;
2.
It does not lose its identity through fabrication or incorporation into a different more complex unit or substance;
3.
It is nonexpendable; that is, if the item is damaged or some of its parts are lost or worn out, it is more feasible to repair the item than to replace it with an entirely new unit; and
4.
Under normal conditions of use, including reasonable care and maintenance, it can be expected to serve its principal purpose for at least one year.
Unless otherwise bound by Federal, State, or local law, the school district will use the criteria above for their equipment classification decisions.
The School Business Administrator/Board Secretary or designee shall ensure that inventories are systematically and accurately recorded and that property records of equipment are adjusted annually.
Major items of equipment shall be subject to annual spot check inventory.
A major loss shall be reported to the Board.
Property records of supplies shall be maintained on a continuous inventory basis.
An item should be classified as a “supply” if it does not meet all the stated equipment criteria outlined above and the cost is not more than the capitalization threshold of $2,000.
The School Business Administrator/Board Secretary or designee shall maintain a system of property records that show, as appropriate to the item recorded, description and identification, manufacturer, year of purchase, initial cost, location, condition and depreciation, and current evaluation in conformity with insurance requirements.
