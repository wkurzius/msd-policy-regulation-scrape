Date Edited: October 2009
The Board of Education and Superintendent of Schools will work with the New Jersey Department of Education to comply with the requirements of the New Jersey Quality Single Accountability Continuum (QSAC) system in accordance with the provisions of N.J.A.C.
6A:30-1.1 et seq.
QSAC is the New Jersey Department of Education monitoring and evaluating system for public school districts.
Public school districts in New Jersey are evaluated in five key component areas of school effectiveness – instruction and program, personnel, fiscal management, operations, and governance – to determine the extent to which the school district is providing a thorough and efficient education.
Weighted quality performance indicators established by the Department of Education shall be used by the Commissioner of Education to assess school district performance and capacity during the comprehensive reviews pursuant to N.J.A.C.
6A:30-3.1 through 3.4, the in-depth evaluation pursuant to N.J.A.C.
6A:30-5.3, and monitoring of an approved QSAC district improvement plan pursuant to N.J.A.C.
6A:30-5.6.
The weighted quality performance indicators shall also be used by the Commissioner in determining whether to initiate intervention activities pursuant to N.J.A.C.
6A:30-6.2, withdrawal from intervention pursuant to N.J.A.C.
6A:30-7.1, and initial placement of Level II, Level III, and State-Operated School Districts on the performance continuum pursuant to N.J.A.C.
6A:30-8.3.
The Commissioner shall conduct a comprehensive review of each public school district every three years.
In the intervening years, the Commissioner shall assess the school district’s performance to determine whether conditions exist in the school district that significantly and negatively impact the educational program or operations of the school district.
The Superintendent shall be responsible for completing the District Performance Review in accordance with the requirements as outlined in N.J.A.C.
6A:30-3.2.
The District Performance Review and a Statement of Assurance prepared in accordance with N.J.A.C.
6A:30-3.2(e) shall be approved by the Board of Education by resolution and submitted to the County Superintendent of Schools in accordance with the provisions of N.J.A.C.
6A:30-3.2(f) and (g).
The district’s District Performance Review and the Statement of Assurance will be reviewed and evaluated in accordance with the requirements of N.J.A.C.
6A:30-3.3.
The Commissioner shall issue a final determination of the school district’s performance and initial placement on the performance continuum in accordance with N.J.A.C.
6A:30-4.1.
The district will be required to commence improvement activities as set forth in N.J.A.C.
6A:30-5.3 through 5.7 in the event it satisfies less than eighty percent of the weighted quality performance indicators in one or more key components of school district effectiveness.
Where appropriate, pursuant to the factors as outlined in N.J.A.C.
6A:30-6.2, the Commissioner may seek forms of partial or full intervention in a school district as outlined in N.J.A.C.
6A:30-6.1 et seq.
Withdrawal from partial or full State intervention shall be in accordance with the provisions of N.J.A.C.
6A:30-7 et seq.
No provision of N.J.A.C.
