5710 - PUPIL GRIEVANCE
Section: Students
Date Created: October 2009
Date Edited: October 2009
The Board of Education believes that pupils are citizens who possess the right to request redress of grievances and that pupils should be encouraged to respect lawful procedures for the resolution of disputes.
Accordingly, the Board will establish and observe procedures by which the grievances of pupils will be heard.
For the purposes of this policy, a pupil grievance means any complaint that arises out of the acts or policies of this Board or the acts of its employees.
A pupil grievance will be heard in the following manner:
1.
A pupil should first make the grievance known to the staff member most closely involved or with a guidance counselor and both shall attempt to resolve the matter informally and directly;
2.
A grievance not resolved at the first step must be reduced to a written statement in which the pupil sets forth the specific nature of the grievance, the facts that gave rise to it, the relief sought, and the reasons why that relief is appropriate;
3.
The written grievance may be submitted to the Building Principal, the Superintendent, and the Board of Education, in that order and within a suitable period of time to be allowed at each level for the hearing of the grievance and the preparation of a response;
4.
At each step beyond the first, the school authority hearing the grievance may summon the parent(s) or legal guardian(s) of a grievant who is not an adult.
The grievant may summon the assistance of his/her parent(s) or legal guardian(s) at any step;
5.
A pupil grievance that proceeds to the Board will be determined promptly and the Board will issue a decision in no more than ten calendar days.
The pupil will be informed of the right to appeal a decision of the Board to the Commissioner of Education.
The Superintendent shall direct all staff members to respect the right of pupils to seek redress of grievances by lawful procedures without fear of reprisal.
Adopted:  20 October 2009
